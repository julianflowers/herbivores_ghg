<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-semantic-scholar">What is semantic scholar</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/me/research">Semantic Scholar</a> (SS) is an online bibliographic database which uses a range of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools to facilitate researchers in retrieving, summarising, managing and analysing citations and references.</p>
<p>The core database has over 200 million references drawn from a wide variety of sources.</p>
<p>It has a powerful graph database which enables rapid appreciation of the connections between authors, citations and journals for bibliometric research.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-ss-api" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ss-api">The SS API</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features is the accessible public API. To speed things up its best to apply for an API key from <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#Partner-Form">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have a key run the following code</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>usethis<span class="sc">::</span><span class="fu">edit_r_environ</span>()</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This opens the R environment file.</p>
<p>Enter the line</p>
<p><code>SEMANTICSCHOLAR_API = &lt;your api key&gt;</code> into the file, save it and restart R.</p>
<p>This will give you 100 API calls per second as opposed to 100 per 5 minutes without it.</p>
<p>Getting information by using APIs is relatively straightforward - API calls are specially constructed URLs which interact with <strong><em>endpoints</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For most of the analyses in this document we will be using the SS Academic Graph API V1.0 (there are others).</p>
<p>This has the uri <a href="https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/V1/paper" class="uri">https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/V1/paper</a> and forms the basis for constructing queries, and accessing data.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Climate affects neighbour-induced changes in leaf chemical defences and tree diversity-herbivory relationships.</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Associational resistance theory predicts that insect herbivory decreases with increasing tree diversity in forest ecosystems. However, the generality of this effect and its underlying mechanisms are still debated, particularly since evidence has accumulated that climate may influence the direction and strength of the relationship between diversity and herbivory.We quantified insect leaf herbivory and leaf chemical defences (phenolic compounds) of silver birch Betula pendula in pure and mixed plots with different tree species composition across 12 tree diversity experiments in different climates. We investigated whether the effects of neighbouring tree species diversity on insect herbivory in birch, that is, associational effects, were dependent on the climatic context, and whether neighbour-induced changes in birch chemical defences were involved in associational resistance to insect herbivory.We showed that herbivory on birch decreased with tree species richness (i.e.&nbsp;associational resistance) in colder environments but that this relationship faded as mean annual temperature increased.Birch leaf chemical defences increased with tree species richness but decreased with the phylogenetic distinctiveness of birch from its neighbours, particularly in warmer and more humid environments.Herbivory was negatively correlated with leaf chemical defences, particularly when birch was associated with closely related species. The interactive effect of tree diversity and climate on herbivory was partially mediated by changes in leaf chemical defences.Our findings confirm that tree species diversity can modify the leaf chemistry of a focal species, hence its quality for herbivores. They further stress that such neighbour-induced changes are dependent on climate and that tree diversity effects on insect herbivory are partially mediated by these neighbour-induced changes in chemical defences.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Climate, Land use and Plant Richness Differently Shape Herbivory on Major Plant Functional Groups</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Interactions between plants and herbivorous invertebrates drive the nutritional quality of resources for higher trophic levels, nutrient cycling and plant-community structure. Thereby, shifts in functional composition of plant communities particularly impact ecosystem processes. However, the current understanding of herbivory is limited concerning climate, land use and plant richness, as comparative studies of different plant functional groups are lacking. This study was conducted on 81 plots covering large climatic and land-use gradients in Bavaria, Germany. We investigated foliar invertebrate herbivory rates (proportional leaf-area loss, following ‘herbivory’) in three major plant functional groups (legumes, non-leguminous forbs, grasses). As drivers we considered multi-annual mean temperature (range: 6.5–10.0 °C), local habitat type (forest, grassland, arable field, settlement), local plant richness (species and family level, ranges: 10–50 species, 5–25 families) and landscape diversity (0.2–3-km scale). Our results largely confirm higher herbivory on legumes than on forbs and grasses. However, herbivory in forests was similar across plant functional groups since herbivory on legumes was low, e.g.&nbsp;lower than on legumes in grasslands. We also observed differential responses of herbivory among plant functional groups in response to plant richness (family level only), but not to landscape diversity. Temperature did not affect overall herbivory, but in grasslands higher temperature decreased herbivory on legumes and increased on forbs and grasses. We conclude that climate, habitat type and family-level plant richness likely assert different effects on herbivory among plant functional groups. This emphasises the importance of functional groups for understanding community-level herbivory and ecosystem functioning.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Synergistic effects of insect herbivory and changing climate on plant volatile emissions in the subarctic tundra</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Climate change increases the insect abundance, especially in Arctic ecosystems. Insect herbivory also significantly increases plant emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are highly reactive in the atmosphere and play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry and physics. However, it is unclear how the effects of insect herbivory on VOC emissions interact with climatic changes, such as warming and increased cloudiness. We assessed how experimental manipulations of temperature and light availability in subarctic tundra, that had been maintained for 30 years at the time of the measurements, affect the VOC emissions from a widespread dwarf birch (Betula nana) when subjected to herbivory by local geometrid moth larvae, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) and the winter moth (Operophtera brumata). Warming and insect herbivory on B. nana stimulated VOC emission rates and altered the VOC blend. The herbivory‐induced increase in sesquiterpene and homoterpene emissions were climate‐treatment‐dependent. Many herbivory‐associated VOCs were more strongly induced in the shading treatment than in other treatments. We showed generally enhanced tundra VOC emissions upon insect herbivory and synergistic effects on the emissions of some VOC groups in a changing climate, which can have positive feedbacks on cloud formation. Furthermore, the acclimation of plants to long‐term climate treatments affects VOC emissions and strongly interacts with plant responses to herbivory. Such acclimation complicates predictions of how climate change, together with interacting biotic stresses, affects VOC emissions in the high latitudes.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Potential of Climate Change and Herbivory to Affect the Release and Atmospheric Reactions of BVOCs from Boreal and Subarctic Forests</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Compared to most other forest ecosystems, circumpolar boreal and subarctic forests have few tree species, and are prone to mass outbreaks of herbivorous insects. A short growing season with long days allows rapid plant growth, which will be stimulated by predicted warming of polar areas. Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from soil and vegetation could be substantial on sunny and warm days and biotic stress may accelerate emission rates. In the atmosphere, BVOCs are involved in various gas-phase chemical reactions within and above forest canopies. Importantly, the oxidation of BVOCs leads to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. SOA particles scatter and absorb solar radiation and grow to form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and participate in cloud formation. Through BVOC and moisture release and SOA formation and condensation processes, vegetation has the capacity to affect the abiotic environment at the ecosystem scale. Recent BVOC literature indicates that both temperature and herbivory have a major impact on BVOC emissions released by woody species. Boreal conifer forest is the largest terrestrial biome and could be one of the largest sources of biogenic mono- and sesquiterpene emissions due to the capacity of conifer trees to store terpene-rich resins in resin canals above and belowground. Elevated temperature promotes increased diffusion of BVOCs from resin stores. Moreover, insect damage can break resin canals in needles, bark, and xylem and cause distinctive bursts of BVOCs during outbreaks. In the subarctic, mountain birch forests have cyclic outbreaks of Geometrid moths. During outbreaks, trees are often completely defoliated leading to an absence of BVOC-emitting foliage. However, in the years following an outbreak there is extended shoot growth, a greater number of leaves, and greater density of glandular trichomes that store BVOCs. This can lead to a delayed chemical defense response resulting in the highest BVOC emission rates from subarctic forest in the 1–3 years after an insect outbreak. Climate change is expected to increase insect outbreaks at high latitudes due to warmer seasons and arrivals of invasive herbivore species. Increased BVOC emission will affect tropospheric ozone (O3) formation and O3 induced oxidation of BVOCs. Herbivore-induced BVOC emissions from deciduous and coniferous trees are also likely to increase the formation rate of SOA and further growth of the particles in the atmosphere. Field experiments measuring the BVOC emission rates, SOA formation rate and particle concentrations within and above the herbivore attacked forest stands are still urgently needed.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Mammalian herbivory shapes intraspecific trait responses to warmer climate and nutrient enrichment</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Variation in intraspecific traits is one important mechanism that can allow plant species to respond to global changes. Understanding plant trait responses to environmental changes such as grazing patterns, nutrient enrichment and climate warming is, thus, essential for predicting the composition of future plant communities. We measured traits of eight common tundra species in a fully factorial field experiment with mammalian herbivore exclusion, fertilization, and passive warming, and assessed how trait responsiveness to the treatments was associated with abundance changes in those treatments. Herbivory exhibited the strongest impact on traits. Exclusion of herbivores increased vegetative plant height by 50% and specific leaf area (SLA) by 19%, and decreased foliar C:N by 11%; fertilization and warming also increased height and SLA but to a smaller extent. Herbivory also modulated intraspecific height, SLA and foliar C:N responses to fertilization and warming, and these interactions were species‐specific. Furthermore, herbivory affected how trait change translated into relative abundance change: increased height under warming and fertilization was more positively related to abundance change inside fences than in grazed plots. Our findings highlight the key role of mammalian herbivory when assessing intraspecific trait change in tundra and its consequences for plant performance under global changes.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Herbivory and climate as drivers of woody plant growth: Do deer decrease the impacts of warming?</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Vegetation at ecotone transitions between open and forested areas is often heavily affected by two key processes: climate change and management of large herbivore densities. These both drive woody plant state-shifts, determining the location and the nature of the limit between open and tree or shrub-dominated landscapes. In order to adapt management to prevailing and future climate, we need to understand how browsing and climatic factors together affect the growth of plants at biome borders. To disentangle herbivory and climate effects, we combined long-term tree growth monitoring and dendroecology to investigate woody plant growth under different temperatures and red deer (Cervus elaphus) herbivory pressures at forest-moorland ecotones in the Scottish highlands. Reforestation and deer densities are core and conflicting management concerns in the area, and there is an urgent need for additional knowledge. We found that deer herbivory and climate had significant and interactive effects on tree growth: in the presence of red deer, pine (Pinus sylvestris) growth responded more strongly to annual temperature than in the absence of deer, possibly reflecting differing plant-plant competition and facilitation conditions. As expected, pine growth was negatively related to deer density and positively to temperature. However, at the tree population level, warming decreased growth when more than 60% of shoots were browsed. Heather (Calluna vulgaris) growth was negatively related to temperature and the direction of the response to deer switched from negative to positive when mean annual temperatures fell below 6.0°C. In addition, our models allow estimates to be made of how woody plant growth responds under specific combinations of temperature and herbivory, and show how deer management can be adapted to predicted climatic changes in order to more effectively achieve reforestation goals. Our results support the hypothesis that temperature and herbivory have interactive effects on woody plant growth, and thus accounting for just one of these two factors is insufficient for understanding plant growth mechanics at biome transitions. Furthermore, we show that climate-driven woody plant growth increases can be negated by herbivory.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Dynamic effects of insect herbivory and climate on tundra shrub growth: Roles of browsing and ramet age</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">To predict shrub responses under climate change in tundra, we need to understand how thermal conditions and herbivory contribute to growth. We hypothesise that shrub growth increases with thermal conditions and precipitation, but that this increase is counteracted by insect herbivory, and that these climate–insect herbivory relationships are modified by both browsing and plant age. We use empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) to analyse a 20‐year time series on willow Salix phylicifolia shoot growth, growing degree days, summer precipitation and herbivory from an experiment at forest–tundra ecotone. The experiment includes manipulations of avian and mammal browsing (fences) and ramet age (pruning to rejuvenate willows). Negative effects of insect herbivory on willow shoot growth were intensified during warmer years, whereas increasing precipitation led to reduced effects. Moreover, the effect of insect herbivores on shoot growth varied with ramet age and vertebrate browsing: younger ramets generally experienced less negative insect herbivore effects, whereas ptarmigan browsing was associated with more positive temperature effects on shoot growth, and reindeer browsing with more negative effects of insect herbivory and precipitation. Synthesis. Our findings show that the negative effects of insect herbivory on shoot growth likely intensify under warmer thermal conditions, but that increasing precipitation can counteract these effects. Moreover, changes in thermal conditions, precipitation and vertebrate browsers all have predictable, albeit complex and nonlinear, effects on shrub growth, highlighting the importance of long‐term experimental data and flexible analytical methods such as EDM for characterising climate and community interactions in artic systems.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Spatial variation in herbivory, climate and isolation predicts plant height and fruit phenotype in Plectritis congesta populations on islands</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Climate and herbivory can each drive natural selection on plant traits but may interact to give rise to different patterns in trait distributions when surveyed across island populations. These different patterns may arise because the occurrence of ungulate herbivores often varies across archipelagos, potentially leading to strong and abrupt spatial heterogeneity in the direction or intensity of natural selection. In contrast, climate tends to vary gradually and thus is more likely to lead to gradual clines in trait values. Population isolation may also affect trait values, given that random genetic drift may fix alleles or traits in the absence of gene flow or because gene flow between populations with similar or opposing selection pressures may augment or swamp the effects of selection. Here, we estimate the independent and interactive effects of deer, climate and isolation on fruit phenotype and plant height in 285 Plectritis congesta populations at 77 island and 44 mainland sites in western North America. Plectritis congesta is a palatable winter annual with two fruit phenotypes based on a simple Mendelian locus with clear dominance and heritable variation in height as a polygenic trait. Fruit phenotype and plant height were well predicted by deer occurrence; plants in populations with resident deer were short (15.0 ± 1.1 cm) and mainly expressed wingless fruits (73.0 ± 4.0%), whereas plants in populations without deer were 2.6 times taller (38.9 ± 5.3 cm) and only 9.0 ± 1.6% expressed wingless fruits. Wingless fruits were less common in populations experiencing wetter conditions with more seasonal variability in temperatures, particularly in the absence of deer. In contrast, population isolation was unrelated to fruit phenotype, except in populations rarely exposed to deer, where plants expressed phenotypes more like those in populations without deer as isolation increased. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that spatial variation in browsing by deer or other factors correlated with it contributes to population‐level variation in fruit phenotype and plant height in P. congesta and that climate leads to a modest spatial gradient in plant height. Synthesis. The occurrence of deer at 285 island and mainland populations of Plectritis congesta predicted plant height and fruit phenotype, supporting the hypothesis that spatial variation in herbivory is a key factor affecting population‐level variation in the distribution of these heritable traits.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Lagging Adaptation to Climate Supersedes Local Adaptation to Herbivory in an Annual Monkeyflower*</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">While native populations are often adapted to historical biotic and abiotic conditions at their home site, populations from other locations in the range may be better adapted to current conditions due to changing climates or extreme conditions in a single year. We examine whether local populations of a widespread species maintain a relative advantage over distant populations that have evolved at sites better matching the current climate. Specifically, we grew lines derived from low- and high-elevation annual populations in California and Oregon of the common monkeyflower (Erythranthe guttata) and conducted phenotypic selection analyses in low- and high-elevation common gardens in Oregon to examine relative fitness and the traits mediating relative fitness. Californian low-elevation populations have the highest relative fitness at the low-elevation site, and Californian high-elevation populations have the highest relative fitness at the high-elevation site. Relative fitness differences are mediated by selection for properly timed transitions to flowering, with selection favoring more rapid growth rates at the low-elevation site and greater vegetative biomass prior to flowering at the high-elevation site. Fitness advantages for Californian plants occur despite incurring higher herbivory at both sites than the native Oregonian plants. Our findings suggest that a lag in adaptation causes maladaptation in extreme years that may be more prevalent in future climates, but local populations still have high growth rates and thus are not yet threatened.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Climate change is impacting forested ecosystemsworldwide, particularly in theNorthernHemisphere wherewarming has increased at a faster rate than the rest of the globe. As climate warms, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) is expected to becomemore successful in northern boreal forests because of its current presence in drier areas ofNorthAmerica. However, large-scale productivity decline of aspen has recently been documented throughout theUnited States andCanada as a result of drought and insect outbreaks.We used tree ringmeasurements (basal area increment (BAI) and stable carbon isotopes (δC)) and remote sensing indices of vegetation productivity (NDVI) to study the impact of climate and damage by the aspen epidermal leafminer (Phyllocnistis populiella) on aspen productivity and physiology in interior Alaska.We found that productivity decreasedwith greater leafmining and was not sensitive to growing season (GS)moisture availability. Although productivity decreased during high leafmining years, it recovered to pre-outbreak levels during years of low insect damage, suggesting a degree of resilience toP. populiellamining. Climate and leafmining interacted to influence tree ring δC, with greater leafmining resulting in decreased δCwhenGSmoisture availability was low.We also found thatNDVIwas negatively associatedwith leafmining, and positively correlatedwith BAI and the δC decrease corresponding tomining. This suggests that NDVI is capturing not only variations in productivity, but also changes in physiology associatedwith P. populiella. Overall, thesefindings indicate that the indirect effects ofP. populiellamining have a larger impact on aspen productivity and physiology than climate under current conditions, and is essential to consider when assessing growth, physiology andNDVI trends in interior Alaska.</td>

<p>The occurrence and amount of herbivory are shaped by bottom-up forces, primarily plant traits (e.g., defenses), and by abiotic factors. Addressing these concurrent effects in a spatial context has been useful in efforts to understand the mechanisms governing variation in plant-herbivore interactions. Still, few studies have evaluated the simultaneous influence of multiple sources of bottom-up variation on spatial variation in herbivory.</p>
<p>METHODS We tested to what extent chemical (phenolics, production of terpenoid glands) and physical (pubescence) defensive plant traits and climatic factors are associated with variation in herbivory by leaf-chewing insects across populations of wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum).</p>
<p>RESULTS We found substantial population variation in cotton leaf defenses and insect leaf herbivory. Leaf pubescence, but not gossypol gland density or phenolic content, was significantly negatively associated with herbivory by leaf-chewing insects. In addition, there were direct effects of climate on defenses and herbivory, with leaf pubescence increasing toward drier conditions and leaf damage increasing toward wetter and cooler conditions. There was no evidence, however, of indirect effects (via plant defenses) of climate on herbivory.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that&nbsp;spatial variation in insect herbivory on wild G. hirsutum is predominantly driven by concurrent and independent influences of population variation in leaf pubescence and climatic factors. |American journal of botany | 2019| 53| 6|Biology , Medicine | |c17b737748a922c5339873e2720a89520814331c |Cloud cover and delayed herbivory relative to timing of spring onset interact to dampen climate change impacts on net ecosystem exchange in a coastal Alaskan wetland |Rapid warming in northern ecosystems over the past four decades has resulted in earlier spring, increased precipitation, and altered timing of plant–animal interactions, such as herbivory. Advanced spring phenology can lead to longer growing seasons and increased carbon (C) uptake. Greater precipitation coincides with greater cloud cover possibly suppressing photosynthesis. Timing of herbivory relative to spring phenology influences plant biomass. None of these changes are mutually exclusive and their interactions could lead to unexpected consequences for Arctic ecosystem function. We examined the influence of advanced spring phenology, cloud cover, and timing of grazing on C exchange in the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta of western Alaska for three years. We combined advancement of the growing season using passive-warming open-top chambers (OTC) with controlled timing of goose grazing (early, typical, and late season) and removal of grazing. We also monitored natural variation in incident sunlight to examine the C exchange consequences of these interacting forcings. We monitored net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE) hourly using an autochamber system. Data were used to construct daily light curves for each experimental plot and sunlight data coupled with a clear-sky model was used to quantify daily and seasonal NEE over a range of incident sunlight conditions. Cloudy days resulted in the largest suppression of NEE, reducing C uptake by approximately 2 g C m−2 d−1 regardless of the timing of the season or timing of grazing. Delaying grazing enhanced C uptake by approximately 3 g C m−2 d−1. Advancing spring phenology reduced C uptake by approximately 1.5 g C m−2 d−1, but only when plots were directly warmed by the OTCs; spring advancement did not have a long-term influence on NEE. Consequently, the two strongest drivers of NEE, cloud cover and grazing, can have opposing effects and thus future growing season NEE will depend on the magnitude of change in timing of grazing and incident sunlight. |Environmental Research Letters | 2019| 110| 6|Environmental Science | |e7d6cece57fbc18cc1e5ea1e0a64226f78ad36f1 |Interactions among herbivory, climate, topography and plant age shape riparian willow dynamics in northern Yellowstone National Park, USA |Understanding how the environmental context modifies the strength of trophic interactions within food webs forms a central challenge in community ecology. Here, we demonstrate the necessity of considering the influence of climate, landscape heterogeneity and demographics for understanding trophic interactions in a well‐studied food web in Yellowstone National Park, USA. We studied riparian willow (Salix spp.) establishment and stem growth reconstructed from tree rings on the northern range of Yellowstone over a 30‐year period that included the reintroduction of a top predator, the grey wolf (Canis lupus). We used climate variables (annual precipitation, stream flow and growing season length), herbivore abundance and landscape descriptors (elevation and topographic wetness index) to predict establishment and growth processes through time before and after the reintroduction of wolves. We fitted Bayesian hierarchical models to establishment data and time series of individual stem heights from 1980 to 2008. Explaining variability in establishment required models with stream flow, annual precipitation and elk abundance. Climate, trophic and landscape covariates interacted with stem age to determine stem height and growth rate through time. Growth rates of most stems ages (2+) declined after the reintroduction of wolves. However, stem growth rates naturally declined with age, and the decline we observed was coincident with faster growth rates for the youngest stems. Mean stem heights at age have remained relatively stable through time for most age classes. Estimated effects of landscape topography had approximately the same magnitude of effect on stem growth rate at age as elk abundance. Synthesis. We show that the effects of modification of a food web cannot be predicted by studying trophic dynamics in isolation. No single driver explained patterns of willow establishment and growth over the past three decades in Yellowstone. Instead, interactions among trophic forces, interannual climate variability and landscape topography together shaped how the ecosystem responded to perturbations. Top‐down effects of ungulates on riparian woody vegetation must be considered in the context of plant age, and climate and landscape heterogeneity. | | 2014| 71| 40|Geography | |fc8f1a31a7a8470f92cb2ba61e97d1ba256fce59 |Biomass and fire dynamics in a temperate forest-grassland mosaic: Integrating multi-species herbivory, climate, and fire with the FireBGCv2/GrazeBGC system |NA | | 2015| 224| 16|Environmental Science | |eb595827059e71a1e349c18dd94572514c9f0679 |Ocean currents and herbivory drive macroalgae-to-coral community shift under climate warming |Significance Global degradation of coral reefs and macroalgal beds can have ecosystem-wide implications for biodiversity, ecological functioning, and ocean resources. However, recent studies in warm temperate zones have documented community shifts from macroalgae to corals, signaling a potential mechanism for coral conservation under climate warming. Here, we present evidence that warming, aided by the dominant poleward-flowing current system, is facilitating the expansion of tropical corals and herbivorous fishes into existing temperate Japanese macroalgae communities, which are contracting faster than they are expanding. Furthermore, our results suggest future climate change may exacerbate this process, potentially compromising the long-term stability of these communities. Future conservation of these communities might require of a more proactive management toward climate adaptation. Coral and macroalgal communities are threatened by global stressors. However, recently reported community shifts from temperate macroalgae to tropical corals offer conservation potential for corals at the expense of macroalgae under climate warming. Although such community shifts are expanding geographically, our understanding of the driving processes is still limited. Here, we reconstruct long-term climate-driven range shifts in 45 species of macroalgae, corals, and herbivorous fishes from over 60 years of records (mainly 1950–2015), stretching across 3,000 km of the Japanese archipelago from tropical to subarctic zones. Based on a revised coastal version of climate velocity trajectories, we found that prediction models combining the effects of climate and ocean currents consistently explained observed community shifts significantly better than those relying on climate alone. Corals and herbivorous fishes performed better at exploiting opportunities offered by this interaction. The contrasting range dynamics for these taxa suggest that ocean warming is promoting macroalgal-to-coral shifts both directly by increased competition from the expansion of tropical corals into the contracting temperate macroalgae, and indirectly via deforestation by the expansion of tropical herbivorous fish. Beyond individual species’ effects, our results provide evidence on the important role that the interaction between climate warming and external forces conditioning the dispersal of organisms, such as ocean currents, can have in shaping community-level responses, with concomitant changes to ecosystem structure and functioning. Furthermore, we found that community shifts from macroalgae to corals might accelerate with future climate warming, highlighting the complexity of managing these evolving communities under future climate change. |Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | 2018| 61| 61|Environmental Science, Medicine | |d838ab03f40df568a4a04342f384566cbe1d5521 |Resilience of tropical tree cover: The roles of climate, fire, and herbivory |Fires and herbivores shape tropical vegetation structure, but their effects on the stability of tree cover in different climates remain elusive. Here, we integrate empirical and theoretical approaches to determine the effects of climate on fire‐ and herbivore‐driven forest‐savanna shifts. We analyzed time series of remotely sensed tree cover and fire observations with estimates of herbivore pressure across the tropics to quantify the fire–tree cover and herbivore–tree cover feedbacks along climatic gradients. From these empirical results, we developed a spatially explicit, stochastic fire‐vegetation model that accounts for herbivore pressure. We find emergent alternative stable states in tree cover with hysteresis across rainfall conditions. Whereas the herbivore–tree cover feedback can maintain low tree cover below 1,100 mm mean annual rainfall, the fire–tree cover feedback can maintain low tree cover at higher rainfall levels. Interestingly, the rainfall range where fire‐driven alternative vegetation states can be found depends strongly on rainfall variability. Both higher seasonal and interannual variability in rainfall increase fire frequency, but only seasonality expands the distribution of fire‐maintained savannas into wetter climates. The strength of the fire–tree cover feedback depends on the spatial configuration of tree cover: Landscapes with clustered low tree‐cover areas are more susceptible to cross a tipping point of fire‐driven forest loss than landscapes with scattered deforested patches. Our study shows how feedbacks involving fire, herbivores, and the spatial structure of tree cover explain the resilience of tree cover across climates. |Global change biology | 2018| 107| 28|Medicine , Environmental Science | |ea9adac819a6c585dc012b4ea339cce6f26d4043 |Role of climate and herbivory on native and alien conifer seedling recruitment at and above the Fennoscandian tree line |Questions: We investigated the importance of climate and herbivory on native and alien conifer colonization of the birch-dominated Fennoscandian tree line by addressing the following questions: (a) … |Journal of Vegetation Science | 2018| 71| 10|Biology | |5880b50f3c06e61056cb94ec1e636a67cada44d8 |Physiological and biochemical responses of a coralline alga and a sea urchin to climate change: Implications for herbivory. |NA |Marine environmental research | 2018| 99| 16|Medicine , Chemistry | |ed2ceba852bad2b704ba6875edbaae6fa876748b |Genetic-Based Susceptibility of a Foundation Tree to Herbivory Interacts With Climate to Influence Arthropod Community Composition, Diversity, and Resilience |Understanding how genetic-based traits of plants interact with climate to affect associated communities will help improve predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity. However, few community-level studies have addressed such interactions. Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) in the southwestern U.S. shows genetic-based resistance and susceptibility to pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus). We sought to determine if susceptibility to scale herbivory influenced the diversity and composition of the extended community of 250+ arthropod species, and if this influence would be consistent across consecutive years, an extreme drought year followed by a moderate drought year. Because scale insects alter the architecture of susceptible trees, it is difficult to separate the direct influences of susceptibility on arthropod communities from the indirect influences of scale-altered tree architecture. To separate these influences, scales were experimentally excluded from susceptible trees for 15 years creating susceptible trees with the architecture of resistant trees, hereafter referred to as scale-excluded trees. Five patterns emerged. (1) In both years, arthropod abundance was 3-4X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (2) Species accumulation curves show that alpha and gamma diversity were 2-3X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (3) Reaction norms of arthropod richness and abundance on individual tree genotypes across years showed genotypic variation in the community response to changes in climate. (4) The genetic-based influence of susceptibility on arthropod community composition is climate dependent. During extreme drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled susceptible trees indicating composition was strongly influenced by tree genetics independent of tree architecture. However, under moderate drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled resistant trees indicating traits associated with tree architecture became more important. (5) One year after extreme drought, the arthropod community rebounded sharply. However, there was a much greater rebound in richness and abundance on resistant compared to susceptible trees suggesting that reduced resiliency in the arthropod community is associated with susceptibility. These results argue that individual genetic-based plant-herbivore interactions can directly and indirectly impact community-level diversity, which is modulated by climate. Understanding such interactions is important for assessing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. |Front.

However, the observed changes based on remote sensing are the result of multiple environmental drivers, and the effects of individual controls such as warming, herbivory, and other disturbances on changes in vegetation biomass, community structure, and ecosystem function remain unclear. We apply ArcVeg, an arctic tundra vegetation dynamics model, to estimate potential changes in vegetation biomass and net primary production (NPP) at the plant community and functional type levels. ArcVeg is driven by soil nitrogen output from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, existing densities of Rangifer populations, and projected summer temperature changes by the NCAR CCSM4.0 general circulation model across the Arctic. We quantified the changes in aboveground biomass and NPP resulting from (i) observed herbivory only; (ii) projected climate change only; and (iii) coupled effects of projected climate change and herbivory. We evaluated model outputs of the absolute and relative differences in biomass and NPP by country, bioclimate subzone, and floristic province. Estimated potential biomass increases resulting from temperature increase only are approximately 5% greater than the biomass modeled due to coupled warming and herbivory. Such potential increases are greater in areas currently occupied by large or dense Rangifer herds such as the Nenets‐occupied regions in Russia (27% greater vegetation increase without herbivores). In addition, herbivory modulates shifts in plant community structure caused by warming. Plant functional types such as shrubs and mosses were affected to a greater degree than other functional types by either warming or herbivory or coupled effects of the two. |Global change biology | 2017| 88| 27|Environmental Science, Medicine | |dcc6deb4db1582f9e3e8096dd68b0e6294f53d14 |Understanding the influence of climate, genetic variation, and herbivory on aspen (Populus tremuloides) growth in Yellowstone National Park |Predation is commonly cited as a top-down effect that structures food webs, with the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone as perhaps the most famous example. However, despite two decades of research, there is still debate as to whether wolves (Canis lupus) have indirectly benefited aspen (Populus tremuloides) by reducing herbivory from elk (Cervus canadensis). As such, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of top-down and bottom-up forces on aspen recruitment in northern Yellowstone. The UW-NPS grant funds were used to conduct a genetic analysis of 59 aspen stands in an effort to determine whether genetic variation is one control of aspen recruitment. During summer 2018, 122 leaves were collected and sent to the Mock Lab at Utah State University.

We investigated the magnitude and the climatic and physical controls of GHG exchange within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska across four distinct vegetation communities formed by herbivory and local microtopography.

The grazed community is also the only vegetation type where CH4 was a larger contributor than CO2 to overall GHG forcing. We found that vegetation community was an important predictor of CO2 and CH4 exchange, demonstrating that variation in regional gas exchange is best explained when the effect of grazing, determined by the difference between grazed and ungrazed communities, is included. Further, we identified an interaction between temperature and vegetation community, indicating that grazed regions could experience the greatest increases in CH4 emissions with warming.

In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to ‘barrens’ when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs. |Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | 2014| 88| 626|Biology , Medicine | |94e18db02e90d074f25c65e42681db18124f6cbb |Interactive effects of climate and nutrient enrichment on patterns of herbivory by different feeding guilds in mangrove forests |Aim: Global warming and eutrophication are major threats to coastal environments worldwide. As a result of differences between temperate and tropical ecosystems in nutrient availability, nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) coupling and carbon retention, primary productivity and biotic interactions in the tropics are predicted to have stronger responses to increased nutrients than in temperate ecosystems. Habitats that occur across broad climatic ranges, such as mangrove forests, provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis by investigating the responses of herbivores to nutrient enrichment in temperate versus tropical latitudes on the same species. | | 2017| 48| 8|Environmental Science | |ef4ea4c2000f8806fe17d8bbf24d06e565ec29ca |Herbivory control over tundra carbon storage under climate change |NA | | 2017| 0| 8|Environmental Science | |3bd81627e7b67a6db29f2e75948cf0c8c2d241dd |Effects of soil resource and herbivory manipulation on temperate-mesic grassland vegetation under a changing climate |……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ………………………………………………………………………………………………………. iv LIST OF TABLES ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… viii LIST OF FIGURES ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. x LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS ………………………………………………………………………………………………….. xii CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION ……………………………………………………………………………………………… 1 Environmental Change In Southeastern Ontario ……………………………………………………………………… 2 A Review Of Soil Moisture Experiments …………………………………………………………………………………….. 2 Productivity And Diversity Along Soil Resource Gradients …………………………………………………….. 3 Interactive Effects Of Herbivory …………………………………………………………………………………………………. 5 Species Composition …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 6 Competition And Plant Body Size ……………………………………………………………………………………………….. 7 Questions And Predictions ………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 8 CHAPTER 2: METHODS …………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 14 Study Site ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 14 Experimental Design ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 14 Data Collection …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 16 Statistical Analyses ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 18 CHAPTER 3: RESULTS ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….. 23 Soil Moisture Treatment Effects On Plot Soil Moisture Water Content ……………………………….. 23 Plot Standing Dead Relative Biomass ………………………………………………………………………………………. 23 | | 2017| 0| 0|Environmental Science | |e71ec2f87354d0979cf9d656afd88b275ee20104 |Interactions among vegetation, climate, and herbivory control greenhouse gas fluxes in a subarctic coastal wetland |High‐latitude ecosystems are experiencing the most rapid climate changes globally, and in many areas these changes are concurrent with shifts in patterns of herbivory.

Effects of herbivory on the distribution and abundance of kelp recruits were examined experimentally at two regions under contrasting ocean climate. Specifically, the abundance and survivorship of kelp recruits and the abundance of macro-herbivores were compared between a ‘cool’ and a ‘warm’ region in northern and central Portugal, respectively. In each region, the abundance of kelp recruits and the intensity of grazing were compared between habitats of different topography within reefs (open reef vs.&nbsp;crevices). Compared to the ‘warm’ region, the abundance of kelp recruits was 3.9 times greater in the ‘cool’ region, where 85% of recruits were found in open reef habitats. In contrast, 87% of recruits in the ‘warm’ region were restricted to crevices. The ‘warm’ region had 140 times greater abundances of sea urchins, 45 times more herbi vorous fish and 4.1 times more grazing marks on kelp recruits than the ‘cool’ region. Grazing assays showed ca. 50 times higher rates of kelp biomass consumption, mainly by fishes, and zero survivorship of kelp recruits in the ‘warm’ relative to the ‘cool’ region. This study suggests both temperature and herbivores affect abundances of kelp recruits across latitudes, and demonstrates how herbivores affect their distribution at local scales, driving kelp recruits into ‘hiding’ in crevices under intense herbivory. Consequently, where net recruitment success is compromised by herbivory, the persistence of kelps will be contingent on availability of topographical refuges. | | 2015| 55| 44|Biology | |0a471a43f2905f28646e65a95c5751a9eb45bda9 |From the individual to the landscape and back: time‐varying effects of climate and herbivory on tree sapling growth at distribution limits |As herbivory can modulate climate‐induced shifts in species distribution, disentangling the relative importance of herbivory and climate on plant growth can help to predict and manage future changes in vegetation, such as those occurring at treeline areas. An individual‐based hierarchical Bayesian time‐series model (individual‐based model; IBM) was developed to estimate the time‐varying impact of climate and herbivory on individual pine sapling height growth in woodland and treeline ecosystems of southern Europe during a 16‐year period. The performance of the IBM was compared to a linear mixed‐effects (LME) model to test for potential inferential effects when individual variability is marginalized. Time‐varying models were also compared to constant parameter approaches. Model fitting and posterior predictive checking suggests a better statistical performance of individual‐scale, time‐varying inference. LME modelling overestimated herbivory effects and underestimated environmental stochastic effects, and model validation indeed suggested severe overfitting in the LME model relative to the IBM strategy. These results reveal a potential failure of common aggregation strategies to correctly resolve the effects of climate and herbivory variability at the individual scale. Moreover, ignoring the time‐varying nature of the effects may preclude the correct estimation of the temporal scale of climate and herbivory impacts. In general, we found stronger individual‐ and time‐averaged effects of summer precipitation relative to the effects of herbivory, particularly at the treelines. Also, individual pine responses showed effects of the same sign more consistently in the case of precipitation. This suggests that precipitation is more pervasive at the population level, while herbivory act as a spatially aggregating force through individual‐level damage. Synthesis. Our results suggest that accounting for individual and temporal variability in ecological inference greatly improves the assessment of the relative importance of climate and herbivory on species distribution shifts. Strong effects of precipitation at the treeline could allow tree upward expansion, although increasing ungulate populations and associated browsing damages might limit positive climatic responses of pine saplings in the near future. In this context, the spatially heterogeneous effect exerted by herbivory could result in diverse vegetation structures in ecotones, adding a new dimension to the predictions on climate‐driven vegetation shifts. | | 2016| 63| 14|Geography | |09c43517713f90029407dc7e2e94de3ceb7bf815 |Climate, herbivory, and fire controls on tropical African forest for the last 60ka |NA | | 2016| 57| 33|Geography | |7ce9d7d96bfd61dc9ea47fe1ca45ee61c91fbe1f |Mean functional traits of lake phytoplankton reflect seasonal and inter-annual changes in nutrients, climate and herbivory |NA | | 2016| 46| 15|Geography | |c194bf944347ffef65258bf32d39405ec693681c |The effect of climate manipulations on the herbivory of the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum (Müller, 1774) (Pulmonata: Agriolimacidae) |NA |International Journal of Biometeorology | 2016| 46| 3|Biology , Medicine | |635fe29f6e3c106d86ca01f3344f3550174840ba |Population-level consequences of herbivory, changing climate, and source-sink dynamics on a long-lived invasive shrub. |Long-lived plant species are highly valued environmentally, economically, and socially, but can also cause substantial harm as invaders. Realistic demographic predictions can guide management decisions, and are particularly valuable for long-lived species where population response times can be long. Long-lived species are also challenging, given population dynamics can be affected by factors as diverse as herbivory, climate, and dispersal. We developed a matrix model to evaluate the effects of herbivory by a leaf-feeding biological control agent released in Australia against a long-lived invasive shrub (mesquite, Leguminoseae: Prosopis spp.). The stage-structured, density-dependent model used an annual time step and 10 climatically diverse years of field data. Mesquite population demography is sensitive to source-sink dynamics as most seeds are consumed and redistributed spatially by livestock. In addition, individual mesquite plants, because they are long lived, experience natural climate variation that cycles over decadal scales, as well as anthropogenic climate change. The model therefore explicitly considered the effects of both net dispersal and climate variation. Herbivory strongly regulated mesquite populations through reduced growth and fertility, but additional mortality of older plants will be required to reach management goals within a reasonable time frame. Growth and survival of seeds and seedlings were correlated with daily soil moisture. As a result, population dynamics were sensitive to rainfall scenario, but population response times were typically slow (20-800 years to reach equilibrium or extinction) due to adult longevity. Equilibrium population densities were expected to remain 5% higher, and be more dynamic, if historical multi-decadal climate patterns persist, the effect being dampened by herbivory suppressing seed production irrespective of preceding rainfall. Dense infestations were unlikely to form under a drier climate, and required net dispersal under the current climate. Seed input wasn’t required to form dense infestations under a wetter climate. Each factor we considered (ongoing herbivory, changing climate, and source-sink dynamics) has a strong bearing on how this invasive species should be managed, highlighting the need for considering both ecological context (in this case, source-sink dynamics) and the effect of climate variability at relevant temporal scales (daily, multi-decadal, and anthropogenic) when deriving management recommendations for long-lived species. |Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America | 2015| 52| 7|Environmental Science, Medicine | |bbbffcfd6be89275fbb6a78228c8c921ba2a905a |Faculty Opinions recommendation of The tropicalization of temperate marine ecosystems: climate-mediated changes in herbivory and community phase shifts. |NA | | 2015| 0| 21|Geography | |4eb180cc0f17342bb951a98d0028ad25d7de70f8 |Contemporary evolution of an invasive plant is associated with climate but not with herbivory |Summary Divergence in plant traits and trait plasticity after invasion has been proposed as mechanisms favouring invasion success. Current hypotheses predict a rapid evolution in response to changes in the abiotic conditions in the area of introduction or to differences in the herbivore consumption pressure caused by a decrease in the enemies associated with the area of origin [e.g.&nbsp;evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis]. The importance of these factors in determining plant geographical divergence has not been yet simultaneously evaluated. Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrub native to eastern South Africa and a recent invader in western South Africa (since ˜100&nbsp;years ago), Australia (&gt;70–100&nbsp;years) and Europe (&gt;30&nbsp;years). These areas differ in their summer drought stress [measured as the ratio of summer precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (P/PET)] and their interactions with herbivores. We performed a common garden experiment with S.&nbsp;pterophorus sampled throughout its entire known distributional area to determine (i) whether native and non-native populations diverge in their traits, as well as the plasticity of these traits in response to water availability and (ii) whether climate and herbivory play a role in the genetic differentiation across regions. Plants from the non-native regions were smaller and had a lower reproductive output than plants from the indigenous area. No geographical differences in phenotypic plasticity were found in response to water availability. Herbivory was not related to the plant geographical divergence. In contrast, our results are consistent with the role of climate as a driver for postinvasive evolution, as suggested by adaptation of plants to a drought cline in the native range, the analogous change in plant traits in independently invaded regions and the convergence of vegetative traits between non-native plants and native plants under similar drought conditions. Native and non-native populations of S.&nbsp;pterophorus differed in plant traits, but not in trait plasticity, in response to their local climatic conditions. Our results are contrary to the role of herbivory as a selective factor after invasion and highlight the importance of climate driving rapid evolution of exotic plants. | | 2015| 48| 20|Biology | |39fcb86b4adf99af03bbaa6cb40b240574afcf65 |Herbivory and climate interact serially to control monoterpene emissions from pinyon pine forests. |The emission of volatile monoterpenes from coniferous trees impacts the oxidative state of the troposphere and multi-trophic signaling between plants and animals. Previous laboratory studies have revealed that climate anomalies and herbivory alter the rate of tree monoterpene emissions. However, no studies to date have been conducted to test these relations in situ. We conducted a two-year field experiment at two semiarid sites dominated by pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) during outbreaks of a specialist herbivore, the southwestern tiger moth (Lophocampa ingens: Arctiidae). We discovered that during the early spring, when herbivory rates were highest, monoterpene emission rates were approximately two to six times higher from undamaged needles on damaged trees, with this increase in emissions due to alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and camphene at both sites. During mid-summer, emission rates did not differ between previously damaged and undamaged trees at the site on the Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains, but rather tracked changes in the temperature and precipitation regime characteristic of the region. As the mid-summer drought progressed at the Eastern Slope site, emission rates were low, but differences between previously damaged and undamaged trees were not statistically significant. Despite no difference in emissions, mid-summer tissue monoterpene concentrations were significantly lower in previously damaged trees at both sites. With the onset of monsoon rains during late summer, emission rates from previously damaged trees increased to levels higher than those of undamaged trees despite the lack of herbivory. We conclude that (1) herbivory systemically increases the flux of terpenes to the atmosphere during the spring, (2) drought overrides the effect of past herbivory as the primary control over emissions during the mid-summer, and (3) a release from drought and the onset of late-summer rains is correlated with a secondary increase in emissions, particularly from herbivore-damaged trees, possibly due to a drought-delayed stimulation of induced monoterpene synthesis and/or increases in stomatal conductance. A greater understanding of the interactive effects of seasonality and herbivory on monoterpene emissions provides much needed information regarding the atmospheric and ecological consequences that these compounds will have for semiarid ecosystems. |Ecology | 2014| 52| 32|Environmental Science, Medicine | |f929132dcce07e280398b8ab8ac4e597ec42882e |Maize Responses Challenged by Drought, Elevated Daytime Temperature and Arthropod Herbivory Stresses: A Physiological, Biochemical and Molecular View |Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the main cereals grown around the world. It is used for human and animal nutrition and also as biofuel. However, as a direct consequence of global climate change, increased abiotic and biotic stress events have been reported in different regions of the world, which have become a threat to world maize yields. Drought and heat are environmental stresses that influence the growth, development, and yield processes of maize crops. Plants have developed dynamic responses at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels that allow them to escape, avoid and/or tolerate unfavorable environmental conditions. Arthropod herbivory can generate resistance or tolerance responses in plants that are associated with inducible and constitutive defenses. Increases in the frequency and severity of abiotic stress events (drought and heat), as a consequence of climate change, can generate critical variations in plant-insect interactions. However, the behavior of herbivorous arthropods under drought scenarios is not well understood, and this kind of stress may have some positive and negative effects on arthropod populations. The simultaneous appearance of different environmental stresses and biotic factors results in very complex plant responses. In this review, recent information is provided on the physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of plants to the combination of drought, heat stress, and the effect on some arthropod pests of interest in the maize crop. |Frontiers in Plant Science | 2021| 206| 5|Biology , Medicine | |77a55dfe67f7dd26f0a07d9e0b1528f2968d8040 |Phenological sensitivity to temperature mediates herbivory |Species interactions drive ecosystem processes and are a major focus of global change research. Among the most consequential interactions expected to shift with climate change are those between insect herbivores and plants, both of which are highly sensitive to temperature. Insect herbivores and their host plants display varying levels of synchrony that could be disrupted or enhanced by climate change, yet empirical data on changes in synchrony are lacking. Using evidence of herbivory on herbarium specimens collected from the northeastern United States and France from 1900 to 2015, we provide evidence that plant species with temperature‐sensitive phenologies experience higher levels of insect damage in warmer years, while less temperature‐sensitive, co‐occurring species do not. While herbivory might be mediated by interactions between warming and phenology through multiple pathways, we suggest that warming might lengthen growing seasons for phenologically sensitive plant species, exposing their leaves to herbivores for longer periods of time in warm years. We propose that elevated herbivory in warm years may represent a previously underappreciated cost to phenological tracking of climate change over longer timescales. |Global change biology | 2021| 97| 5|Medicine | |2735edf1aed19a33d8536ffee854d38f44800a8c |Premature losses of leaf area in response to drought and insect herbivory through a leaf lifespan gradient |NA | | 2021| 66| 1|Biology | |ae774d632fbe2bfe4fe85944315011cde1336741 |Contrasting response of native and non‐native plants to disturbance and herbivory in mountain environments |Climate warming and increasing human disturbance are expected to promote non‐native plant invasions in mountain ecosystems.

The plant defense hormone jasmonate promotes resistance to diverse herbivores, but how this wound signal impacts the plant’s ability to cope with a combination of herbivory and elevated temperature remains unknown. Here, we show that heat shock proteins contribute to enhanced jasmonate responses in tomato plants subjected to simulated heat waves. Herbivore-induced jasmonate signaling at elevated temperature, however, blocked stomatal opening and leaf hyponasty, leading to leaf overheating, reduced photosynthesis, and growth inhibition. Our results show how signal conflict between biotic and abiotic stress may exaggerate crop losses under warming conditions that accelerate herbivory, potentially jeopardizing food security. As global climate change brings elevated average temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, pressure from biotic stresses will become increasingly compounded by harsh abiotic stress conditions. The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) promotes resilience to many environmental stresses, including attack by arthropod herbivores whose feeding activity is often stimulated by rising temperatures. How wound-induced JA signaling affects plant adaptive responses to elevated temperature (ET), however, remains largely unknown. In this study, we used the commercially important crop plant Solanum lycopersicum (cultivated tomato) to investigate the interaction between simulated heat waves and wound-inducible JA responses. We provide evidence that the heat shock protein HSP90 enhances wound responses at ET by increasing the accumulation of the JA receptor, COI1. Wound-induced JA responses directly interfered with short-term adaptation to ET by blocking leaf hyponasty and evaporative cooling. Specifically, leaf damage inflicted by insect herbivory or mechanical wounding at ET resulted in COI1-dependent stomatal closure, leading to increased leaf temperature, lower photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate, and growth inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 reversed these effects to recapitulate the phenotype of a JA-insensitive mutant lacking the COI1 receptor. As climate change is predicted to compound biotic stress with larger and more voracious arthropod pest populations, our results suggest that antagonistic responses resulting from a combination of insect herbivory and moderate heat stress may exacerbate crop losses. |Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | 2020| 47| 21|Biology , Medicine | |59d654d0410187f24511677fc5ca0db677201e97 |Interspecific boreal shrub growth response to climate, fertilization and herbivory. |NA | | 2015| 0| 3|Biology | |7ee6503399a82a06827d9f95c44308df0718b055 |Herbaria Reveal Herbivory and Pathogen Increases and Shifts in Senescence for Northeastern United States Maples Over 150 Years |Recent studies suggest climate-related delays in the timing of leaf coloration and abscission in maple trees but lack baseline data prior to the late 20th century. To better understand how autumn foliar phenology and late-season damage risks have changed for this genus over the past century, we evaluated 2,972 digitized herbaria specimens of red and sugar maple collected between 1826 and 2016 for the presence of leaves, autumn leaf coloration, and pathogen or herbivore damage. We found that the onset (first appearance) of colored leaves has shifted 0.26 days later each year, leading to a delay of more than a month in autumn phenology since 1880. We find that these shifts are related to precipitation regimes in both the fall and summer seasons and that more severe droughts are associated with higher probabilities of colored leaves. Moreover, we found that the probability of both herbivory and pathogen damage has increased significantly over the study period. In particular, we find a strong association between increasing summer drought conditions and increased probability of herbivory. Furthermore, the presence of foliar damage increased the probability of leaf coloration on herbaria specimens. However, the end-of-season abscission date (last appearance of leaves) was strongly associated with herbivory and climate in a contrary direction: Increasing yearly drought, higher fall temperatures, and the presence of herbivory were associated with earlier abscission. In fact, the last leaf dates for specimens with herbivory were nearly 2 weeks earlier than specimens without herbivore damage. Our study documents significant changes in maple senescence over the last 150 years and suggests that incorporating herbivory into models may improve our ability to predict forest responses to climate shifts. |Frontiers in Forests and Global Change | 2021| 135| 0|NULL | |9f45183889c92bd2fe6d4a19d85a65abf4c7dc06 |Effect of Altitudinal Variation on Phenology and Herbivory in Trifolium repens&nbsp; |: Phenology is an important ecological feature that can be inﬂuenced by many aspects. Mountainous regions are great sites to perform studies to help the understanding of the reproductive cycle of plants and herbivores. In this work, the phenological cycle and leaf damage rate caused by herbivores in Trifolium repens were observed among three different altitudes in the Itatiaia National Park from June to August 2021, and statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects models. The preliminary results show that altitude affected vegetative phenophases and herbivory ( p &lt; 0.01). The highest altitude sampled stands out for having less open and damaged leaves and for being the only altitude without any ﬂowering events. Nevertheless, the inﬂuence of growing season climate on phenology is often observed in transplanting experiments, in which at lower altitudes plants typically develop earlier than those in their higher altitude native sites. As for the damage caused by herbivores, it is known that environmental conditions of higher altitudes can reduce the aptitude of various insects. |IECPS 2021 | 2021| 37| 0|NULL | |40580ee67e4265423c24680a85fbc0f666fd7495 |Strong Interactive Effects of Warming and Insect Herbivory on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Dynamics at Subarctic Tree Line |Warming will likely stimulate Arctic primary production, but also soil C and N mineralization, and it remains uncertain whether the Arctic will become a sink or a source for CO2. Increasing insect herbivory may also dampen the positive response of plant production and soil C input to warming. We conducted an open-air warming experiment with Subarctic field layer vegetation in North Finland to explore the effects of warming (+3°C) and reduced insect herbivory (67% reduction in leaf damage using an insecticide) on soil C and N dynamics. We found that plant root growth, soil C and N concentrations, microbial biomass C, microbial activity, and soil NH4+ availability were increased by both warming and reduced herbivory when applied alone, but not when combined. Soil NO3– availability increased by warming only and in-situ soil respiration by reduced herbivory only. Our results suggest that increasing C input from vegetation under climate warming increases soil C concentration, but also stimulates soil C turnover. On the other hand, it appears that insect herbivores can significantly reduce plant growth. If their abundance increases with warming as predicted, they may curtail the positive effect of warming on soil C concentration. Moreover, our results suggest that temperature and herbivory effects on root growth and soil variables interact strongly, which probably arises from a combination of N demand increasing under lower herbivory and soil mineral N supply increasing under higher temperature. This may further complicate the effects of rising temperatures on Subarctic soil C dynamics. |Frontiers in Forests and Global Change | 2021| 92| 0|NULL | |1dc5388ce9c90f065419d5d3c64171c83657dece |Fire Severity and Size Alter Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) Regeneration and Defense Against Ungulate Herbivory |Fire Severity and Size Alter Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) Regeneration and Defense Against Ungulate Herbivory Ho Yi Wan Department of Plant and Wildlife Sciences, BYU Master of Science Human activities and rapid global climate change are altering fire regimes with potential threat to the stability of aspen ecosystems in North America. Aspen is an early successional species that plays an important role in post-fire forest reestablishment, but chronic browsing on juvenile aspen by large ungulate herbivores after fire can be detrimental and lead to regeneration failure. Although larger and more severe fires are expected to become more prominent, whether and how this may influence aspen and ungulate communities remains unclear. The objective of this research was to examine how the relationship between aspen and ungulate communities might be influenced by variation in fire severity and size. In 2012, we examined browse patterns, growth responses and defense chemistry (phenolic glycoside and condensed tannins) concentrations of regenerating aspen that experienced variable burn severity in the 2010 Twitchell Canyon Fire, Utah, USA. We found that greater light availability in higher severity burn environments enhanced aspen tolerance and resistance against herbivory by increasing growth potential and defense chemistry concentrations of aspen. These results suggest that burn severity influences plant-herbivore interactions through bottom-up and top-down forces, and that higher fire severity increases post-disturbance vegetation recruitment potential by increasing resilience to herbivory. In 2013, we characterized aspen and ungulate patterns of 25 fires that spread across five National Forests (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache NF, Ashley NF, Fishlake NF, Dixie NF, and Manti-La Sal NF) in the state of Utah. We identified interaction effects between fire size and severity that strongly influenced aspen and ungulate densities. Fire size and severity are important ecological filters that can interact to affect forest reestablishment and community response. This information is useful in developing decision-making tools for wildfire and ungulate management that can more effectively increase the long-term resilience of forests systems. | | 2021| 141| 0|NULL | |bd19685fa6db2ee518782f1d126b274e1eaf1f66 |Effects of experimental watering but not warming on herbivory vary across a gradient of precipitation |Abstract Climate change can affect biotic interactions, and the impacts of climate on biotic interactions may vary across climate gradients. Climate affects biotic interactions through multiple drivers, although few studies have investigated multiple climate drivers in experiments. We examined the effects of experimental watering, warming, and predator access on leaf water content and herbivory rates of woolly bear caterpillars (Arctia virginalis) on a native perennial plant, pacific silverweed (Argentina anserina ssp. pacifica), at two sites across a gradient of precipitation in coastal California. Based on theory, we predicted that watering should increase herbivory at the drier end of the gradient, predation should decrease herbivory, and watering and warming should have positive interacting effects on herbivory. Consistent with our predictions, we found that watering only increased herbivory under drier conditions. However, watering increased leaf water content at both wetter and drier sites. Warming increased herbivory irrespective of local climate and did not interact with watering. Predation did not affect herbivory rates. Given predictions that the study locales will become warmer and drier with climate change, our results suggest that the effects of future warming and drying on herbivory may counteract each other in drier regions of the range of Argentina anserina. Our findings suggest a useful role for range‐limit theory and the stress‐gradient hypothesis in predicting climate change effects on herbivory across stress gradients. Specifically, if climate change decreases stress, herbivory may increase, and vice versa for increasing stress. In addition, our work supports previous suggestions that multiple climate drivers are likely to have dampening effects on biotic interactions due to effects in different directions, though this is context‐dependent. |Ecology and evolution | 2021| 47| 0|Medicine | |868f795d42a57fefbc36c0218a9a88abbecc2bfc |Idiosyncratic responses to simulated herbivory by root fungal symbionts in a subarctic meadow |ABSTRACT Plant-associated fungi have elementary roles in ecosystem productivity. There is little information on the interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal symbiosis, fine endophytic (FE) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi, and their host plants in cold climate systems. In particular, the environmental filters potentially driving the relative abundance of these root symbionts remain unknown. We investigated the interlinkage of plant and belowground fungal responses to simulated herbivory (clipping, fertilization, and trampling) in a subarctic meadow system. AM and FE frequency in the two target plant roots, Potentilla crantzii and Saussurea alpina, was unaffected by simulated herbivory, highlighting the importance and resilience of arbuscule forming mycorrhizas in a range of environmental conditions. Fertilization and trampling increased DSE colonization in P. crantzii roots although generally P. crantzii performance was reduced in these plots. The idiosyncratic responses by DSE fungal frequency in the two host plants in our experiment indicate that the host plant identity has a pivotal role in the DSE fungus–plant outcome. DSE fungal frequency did not respond to environmental manipulations in a manner similar to arbuscular mycorrhizas, suggesting that they have a different role in plant ecology. |Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research | 2021| 120| 0|Biology | |101c78713ac4c7cc109a592660ee26a91322445a |Response of Background Herbivory in Mature Birch Trees to Global Warming |Given the time scale based on the duration of exposure to global warming, natural climate-gradient studies and experimental manipulations have detected long-term (decades to centuries) and short-term (years to decades) ecological responses to global warming. Combination of these two complementary approaches within a single study may enable prediction of the likely responses of ecological processes to global warming. To understand how global warming affects plant–herbivore interactions within a canopy of Erman’s birch, we combined an elevational gradient study and a warming experiment involving mature birch trees in which the soil and tree branches were warmed separately. In the elevational gradient study, herbivory by chewing insects and plant growth increased as elevation decreased, and the concentrations of condensed tannins and total phenolics in the leaves decreased. In the warming experiment, soil warming alone increased herbivory, and the addition of branch warming amplified the effect on herbivory. Soil warming alone decreased the tannin concentration, and the addition of branch warming led to a further reduction. The variation in herbivory was best explained by the tannin content of leaves. Our experimental results demonstrate that the decreased tannin content of leaves due to a combination of soil and branch warming was an important driver of increased herbivory in the canopy of the mature birch trees. The similar tendencies in the short- and long-term responses imply that global warming is likely to increase background herbivory in mature birch trees by decreasing the tannin content of leaves in the canopy. |Frontiers in Forests and Global Change | 2021| 82| 0|NULL | |311a2ec46d473eb3707751f5013a76c724fefe73 |Erratum to: The interacting effects of temperature, ground disturbance, and herbivory on seedling establishment: implications for treeline advance with climate warming |NA |Plant Ecology | 2010| 45| 22|Environmental Science | |b34d228d35a807a7512136988f42cc98c5822dfa |Vegetation change (1988-2010) in Camdeboo National Park (South Africa), using fixed-point photo monitoring: The role of herbivory and climate |Fixed-point photo monitoring supplemented by animal census data and climate monitoring potential has never been explored as a long-term monitoring tool for studying vegetation change in the arid and semi-arid national parks of South Africa. The long-term (1988–2010), fixed-point monitoring dataset developed for the Camdeboo National Park, therefore, provides an important opportunity to do this. Using a quantitative estimate of the change in vegetation and growth form cover in 1152 fixed-point photographs, as well as series of step-point vegetation surveys at each photo monitoring site, this study documented the extent of vegetation change in the park in response to key climate drivers, such as rainfall, as well as land use drivers such as herbivory by indigenous ungulates. We demonstrated the varied response of vegetation cover within three main growth forms (grasses, dwarf shrubs [ 1 m]) in three different vegetation units and landforms (slopes, plains, rivers) within the Camdeboo National Park since 1988. Sites within Albany Thicket and Dwarf Shrublands showed the least change in vegetation cover, whilst Azonal vegetation and Grassy Dwarf Shrublands were more dynamic. Abiotic factors such as drought and flooding, total annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality appeared to have the greatest influence on growth form cover as assessed from the fixed-point photographs. Herbivory appeared not to have had a noticeable impact on the vegetation of the Camdeboo National Park as far as could be determined from the rather coarse approach used in this analysis and herbivore densities remained relatively low over the study duration. Conservation implications: We provided an historical assessment of the pattern of vegetation and climatic trends that can help evaluate many of South African National Parks’ biodiversity monitoring programmes, especially relating to habitat change. It will help arid parks in assessing the trajectories of vegetation in response to herbivory, climate and management interventions. | | 2013| 78| 19|Geography | |1186875270be97d632714b0f42c084fb64557952 |Potential impacts of climate change on patterns of insect herbivory on understorey plant species: A transplant experiment |Species-specific responses to climate change will lead to changes in species interactions across multiple trophic levels. Interactions between plants and their insect herbivores, in particular, may become increasingly disrupted if mobile herbivores respond more rapidly to climatic change than their associated host plants. We present a multispecies transplant experiment aimed at assessing potential climatic impacts on patterns of leaf herbivory. Four shrubby understorey plant species were transplanted outside their native range into a climate 2.5°C warmer in annual mean temperature. After 12 months, we assessed the types and amount of herbivore leaf damage, compared with plants transplanted to a control site within their native range. The overall amount of foliage loss to herbivores ranged from approximately 3–10% across species and sites, a range consistent with most estimates of leaf loss in other studies. The most common types of leaf damage were sucking and chewing and this pattern was consistent for all four plant species at all sites. There were no significant differences in levels and patterns of herbivory between control and warm sites for three out of four plant species. This suggests that with moderate climate warming, most herbivory will continue to be dominated by chewers and suckers, and that the overall level of foliage loss will be similar to that experienced presently. | | 2014| 41| 8|Biology | |1306a484ea731ed9544c04bfd7e2224c59adc13a |Herbivory and warming interact in opposing patterns of covariation between arctic shrub species at large and local scales |Significance Whether climatic conditions or biotic interactions determine species abundances and distributions has been a persistent question in ecology. Furthermore, its answer has long been considered scale-dependent, with climate presumably constraining abundance and distributions at large scales and species interactions determining them at local scales. We conducted a 15-y field experiment to test more recent theory that predicts abiotic conditions and biotic interactions can shape patterns of species covariation at both large and local scales. Our results affirm this prediction, offering insights that will help improve predictions of species’ distributional responses to climate change. A major challenge in predicting species’ distributional responses to climate change involves resolving interactions between abiotic and biotic factors in structuring ecological communities. This challenge reflects the classical conceptualization of species’ regional distributions as simultaneously constrained by climatic conditions, while by necessity emerging from local biotic interactions. A ubiquitous pattern in nature illustrates this dichotomy: potentially competing species covary positively at large scales but negatively at local scales. Recent theory poses a resolution to this conundrum by predicting roles of both abiotic and biotic factors in covariation of species at both scales, but empirical tests have lagged such developments. We conducted a 15-y warming and herbivore-exclusion experiment to investigate drivers of opposing patterns of covariation between two codominant arctic shrub species at large and local scales. Climatic conditions and biotic exploitation mediated both positive covariation between these species at the landscape scale and negative covariation between them locally. Furthermore, covariation between the two species conferred resilience in ecosystem carbon uptake. This study thus lends empirical support to developing theoretical solutions to a long-standing ecological puzzle, while highlighting its relevance to understanding community compositional responses to climate change. |Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | 2021| 82| 3|Medicine | |4363e10a2991060926b2246640c0695ddf9fec6b |GRASSLAND SUSTAINABILITY IN KENTUCKY: CASE STUDIES QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SLUG HERBIVORY IN PASTURES AND DIFFERENT HOME LAWN SYSTEMS ON TURF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS |OF THESIS GRASSLAND SUSTAINABILITY IN KENTUCKY: CASE STUDIES QUANTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON SLUG HERBIVORY IN PASTURES AND DIFFERENT HOME LAWN SYSTEMS ON TURF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Grasslands comprise the greatest biome by land area, are sensitive to environmental factors affected by climate change, and can impact future climate change through their ability to store and release greenhouse gasses (GHGs). I performed two studies: 1) evaluated the effects of increased temperature and precipitation on slug herbivory/abundance and pasture forage production; 2) quantified different homeowner lawn system effects on soil-to-atmosphere GHG emissions. Climate change will likely affect pasture forage production, with implications for slug herbivory and abundance. I found little evidence that slugs have or will have significant effects on pasture production or plant community. Warming altered the abundance of slugs and modified seasonal trends, increasing slug abundance in spring/winter and reducing it in late-summer/fall, through both direct effects and changes in plant community and forage quality. Home lawns vary in levels of management, influencing the exchange of GHGs. I quantified the effects of three common home lawn systems of central Kentucky on GHG emissions, but found no significant differences in CO2, N2O, and NH3 fluxes. My research suggests that slug herbivory is not a dominant ecological process in Kentucky pastures and that common home lawn systems have similar soil-to-atmosphere GHG emissions. | | 2014| 115| 2|Environmental Science | |c2434546842a49cf166cb19699b538fbc7f43c89 |Ectothermic omnivores increase herbivory in response to rising temperature |Higher temperatures as a consequence of global climate change may considerably alter trophic interactions. Ectothermic herbivores and carnivores generally ingest more food with rising temperature as their metabolic rates increase with rising temperature. However, omnivorous ectotherms may respond in two ways: quantitatively by consuming more food and qualitatively by altering their degree of herbivory or carnivory through a diet shift. We hypothesize that rising temperature will increase herbivory of ectothermic omnivores as herbivory increases towards the equator. We tested the hypothesis in a freshwater model system in which ectothermic omnivores are prevalent, by applying two approaches, a temperature manipulation experiment and a literature study. We performed feeding trials with a juvenile aquatic ectothermic omnivore (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis ) at different temperatures ranging from 12 to 27ºC, supplying them with both animal food and plant material, and directly quantified their consumption rates over time. The results showed that snails cultured at high temperatures (&gt; 21ºC) increased the proportion of plant material in their diets after 17 days, which supports our hypothesis.

Current hypotheses predict a rapid divergence of plant chemical defenses in response to changes in herbivore consumption pressure caused by a decrease in the enemies from the area of origin (e.g.&nbsp;evolution of increased competitive ability –EICA– hypothesis) or in response to differences in the climatic conditions. Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrub native from Eastern South Africa that has recently invaded Western South Africa, Australia and Europe. The four distributional regions of S. pterophorus differ in their levels of herbivory1 and summer drought stress. Here we evaluated 1) whether native and introduced populations diverged in their genetically-based levels of chemical defenses, and 2) whether these biogeographical differences were driven by post-invasive changes in herbivory or climate. We performed a common garden with 54 populations of S. pterophorus sampled throughout the entire known worldwide distributional area, including the native and three non-native ranges. Genetically-based chemical defense concentrations varied among regions. Contrary to the EICA hypothesis we found higher levels of chemical defenses in the introduced populations. The role of enemy release and summer drought stress are simultaneously evaluated as potential drivers for the evolution of chemical defenses. This is the first study to evaluate rapid evolution of an exotic plant covering the entire known distributional area of a species. 1Castells et al.&nbsp;(2013) Reduced seed predation after invasion supports enemy release in a broad biogeographical survey.

Consequently, crop yields will be impacted simultaneously by abiotic and biotic stressors. Extensive yield losses due to such climate change stressors might, however, be mitigated by ecosystem services such as insect pollination. We examined the single and combined effects of water stress, insect herbivory and insect pollination on faba bean yield components and above‐ and belowground plant biomass under realistic field conditions. We used rainout shelters to simulate a scenario in line with climate change projections, with adequate water supply at sowing followed by a long period without precipitation. This induced a gradually increasing water stress, culminating around crop flowering and yield formation. We found that gradually increasing water stress combined with insect herbivory by aphids interactively shaped yield in faba beans. Individually, aphid herbivory reduced yield by 79% and water stress reduced yield by 52%. However, the combined effect of water stress and aphid herbivory reduced yield less (84%) than the sum of the individual stressor effects. In contrast, insect pollination increased yield by 68% independently of water availability and insect herbivory. Our results suggest that yield losses can be greatly reduced when both water stress and insect herbivory are reduced simultaneously. In contrast, reducing only one stressor has negligible benefits on yield as long as the crop is suffering from the other stressor. We call for further exploration of interactions among ecosystem services and biotic and abiotic stressors that simulate realistic conditions under climate change. |Global change biology | 2020| 85| 10|Medicine, Biology | |d4d40bdafd82db5a13cd1e724fad1b310c7fb8ff |Insect herbivory dampens Subarctic birch forest C sink response to warming |NA |Nature Communications | 2020| 57| 10|Environmental Science, Medicine | |66cb3f3666ffba8b26681a10c9a53254f4e33ffd |Weak latitudinal gradients in insect herbivory for dominant rangeland grasses of North America |Abstract Patterns of insect herbivory may follow predictable geographical gradients, with greater herbivory at low latitudes. However, biogeographic studies of insect herbivory often do not account for multiple abiotic factors (e.g., precipitation and soil nutrients) that could underlie gradients. We tested for latitudinal clines in insect herbivory as well as climatic, edaphic, and trait‐based drivers of herbivory. We quantified herbivory on five dominant grass species over 23 sites across the Great Plains, USA. We examined the importance of climate, edaphic factors, and traits as correlates of herbivory. Herbivory increased at low latitudes when all grass species were analyzed together and for two grass species individually, while two other grasses trended in this direction. Higher precipitation was related to more herbivory for two species but less herbivory for a different species, while higher specific root length was related to more herbivory for one species and less herbivory for a different species. Taken together, results highlight that climate and trait‐based correlates of herbivory can be highly contextual and species‐specific. Patterns of insect herbivory on dominant grasses support the hypothesis that herbivory increases toward lower latitudes, though weakly, and indicates that climate change may have species‐specific effects on plant–herbivore interactions. |Ecology and evolution | 2020| 73| 3|Biology , Medicine | |eb9c94568ea4e52882182b06df691bb78ccf8889 |The effect of community‐wide phytochemical diversity on herbivory reverses from low to high elevation |Theory predicts that a large fraction of phytochemical diversity—the richness of individual chemical compounds produced by plants—governs the complexity of interactions between plants and their herbivores. While the effect of specific classes of chemical compounds on plant resistance against herbivores has been largely documented, the effect of community‐level variation in phytochemical diversity on plant–herbivore interactions has so far received minimal consideration. We hypothesized that plant communities bearing on average higher levels of phytochemical diversity should sustain lower herbivory rates, overall. Yet, the magnitude of this effect could vary across different environmental conditions, potentially because of climate‐mediated effects on phytochemical production and changes in herbivore community richness and composition. To address these hypotheses, we used previous knowledge of species‐level phytochemical make‐up for more than 400 plant species of the Swiss Alps. Using common garden experiments, we estimated season‐wide herbivore damage on low (average 3,500 unique molecules) and high (average 4,500 unique molecules) phytochemical diversity plant communities that were planted in the colline, mountain and alpine vegetation sites along two elevation transects in the Alps. We found that high phytochemical diversity plant communities showed reduced levels of herbivore damage in the colline (low elevation) sites, but this pattern reversed in the alpine (high elevation) sites. Our results suggest that the outcome of phytochemical diversity on plant–herbivore interactions depends on the characteristics of the local herbivore communities, together with trade‐offs between chemical defences and other plant traits (i.e.&nbsp;physical defences and plant palatability). Synthesis. Phytochemical diversity is a key component of functional diversity, influencing community composition and dynamics. We show that the effect of phytochemical diversity on herbivory is environmental‐dependent, generating ecological switches when moving from low to high elevation. Through upward movement of plants under climate change, phytochemical community structure will be likely modified, ultimately disrupting local community assembly processes. |Journal of Ecology | 2020| 65| 3|Biology | |50db852a5aed36b47877eef2f39c9ee8396764fb |Ocean warming combined with nutrient enrichment increases the risk of herbivory during cultivation of the marine macroalga Undaria Pinnatifida |Recent declines of macroalgal forests due to climate change imply that the aquaculture production of macroalgae may also be negatively affected by ocean warming. It has previously been shown that nutrient enrichment can offset the negative impact of warming on the survival and growth of the cultivated macroalga Undaria pinnatifida, although it can also increase the risk of herbivory by unrecognized mesograzers. Observations of several hundreds or thousands of the isopod Cymodocea japonica around U. pinnatifida cultivation ropes in autumn, prompted the analysis of their size-frequency distribution, relationship between body size and consumption rate, and combined effects of elevated temperature and nutrient enrichment on the consumption rate of the algae by the isopod in the current study. Although the body size of the isopods collected in autumn was smaller than those collected in winter and spring, the consumption rate of 600 small isopods was similar to the rate of a large individual. Additionally, the consumption rate doubled in response to an increase in temperature from 15 to 18°C and nutrient enrichment, and tripled with their combination. These results suggest that ocean warming combined with nutrient enrichment increase the risk of herbivory during U. pinnatifida cultivation, especially during isopod outbreak periods. | | 2020| 50| 5|Biology | |2b937e7cb1a2b0d679e626ba7cdfa62918d7dec6 |Hypoxia and Acidification, Individually and in Combination, Disrupt Herbivory and Reduce Survivorship of the Gastropod, Lacuna vincta |Acidification and deoxygenation are two consequences of climate change that also co-occur in eutrophied coastal zones and can have deleterious effects on marine life. While the effects of hypoxia on marine herbivores have been well-studied, how ocean acidification combined with hypoxia affects herbivory is poorly understood. This study examined how herbivory and survival by the gastropod Lacuna vincta grazing on the macroalgae Ulva rigida was influenced by hypoxia and ocean acidification, alone and in combination, with and without food limitation. Experiments exposed L. vincta to a range of environmentally realistic dissolved oxygen (0.7 – 8 mg L–1) and pH (7.3 – 8.0 total scale) conditions for 3 – 72 h, with and without a starvation period and quantified herbivory and survival. While acidified conditions (pH &lt; 7.4) reduced herbivory when combined with food limitation, low oxygen conditions (&lt; 4 mg L–1) reduced herbivory and survival regardless of food supply. When L. vincta were starved and grazed in acidified conditions herbivory was additively reduced, whereas starvation and hypoxia synergistically reduced grazing rates. Overall, low oxygen had a more inhibitory effect on herbivory than low pH. Shorter exposure times (9, 6, and 3 h) were required to reduce grazing at lower DO levels (∼2.4, ∼1.6, and ∼0.7 mg L–1, respectively). Herbivory ceased entirely following a three-hour exposure to DO of 0.7 mg L–1 suggesting that episodes of diurnal hypoxia disrupt grazing by these gastropods. The suppression of herbivory in response to acidified and hypoxic conditions could create a positive feedback loop that promotes ‘green tides’ whereby reduced grazing facilitates the overgrowth of macroalgae that cause nocturnal acidification and hypoxia, further disrupting herbivory and promoting the growth of macroalgae. Such feedback loops could have broad implications for estuarine ecosystems where L. vincta is a dominant macroalgal grazer and will intensify as climate change accelerates. |Frontiers in Marine Science | 2020| 125| 4|Chemistry | |141c4e953b7ac355ea14c354177f5c48ac6b9126 |Herbivory in Seagrass Meadows: an Evolving Paradigm |NA |Estuaries and Coasts | 2020| 265| 3|Biology | |218b4de8f3c02b893beabc22c78f155b1a71eccd |Biases in estimation of insect herbivory from herbarium specimens |NA |Scientific Reports | 2020| 76| 5|Medicine, Biology | |f374d9aed7f3e47eb70b0f7655e31fa1f9b0a0c5 |Testing for the Effects and Consequences of Mid Paleogene Climate Change on Insect Herbivory |Background The Eocene, a time of fluctuating environmental change and biome evolution, was generally driven by exceptionally warm temperatures. The Messel (47.8 Ma) and Eckfeld (44.3 Ma) deposits offer a rare opportunity to take a census of two, deep-time ecosystems occurring during a greenhouse system. An understanding of the long-term consequences of extreme warming and cooling events during this interval, particularly on angiosperms and insects that dominate terrestrial biodiversity, can provide insights into the biotic consequences of current global climatic warming. Methodology/Principal Findings We compare insect-feeding damage within two middle Eocene fossil floras, Messel and Eckfeld, in Germany. From these small lake deposits, we studied 16,082 angiosperm leaves and scored each specimen for the presence or absence of 89 distinctive and diagnosable insect damage types (DTs), each of which was allocated to a major functional feeding group, including four varieties of external foliage feeding, piercing- and-sucking, leaf mining, galling, seed predation, and oviposition. Methods used for treatment of presence–absence data included general linear models and standard univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Conclusions/Significance Our results show an unexpectedly high diversity and level of insect feeding than comparable, penecontemporaneous floras from North and South America. In addition, we found a higher level of herbivory on evergreen, rather than deciduous taxa at Messel. This pattern is explained by a ca. 2.5-fold increase in atmospheric CO2 that overwhelmed evergreen antiherbivore defenses, subsequently lessened during the more ameliorated levels of Eckfeld times. These patterns reveal important, previously undocumented features of plant-host and insect-herbivore diversification during the European mid Eocene. |PloS one | 2012| 123| 53|Biology , Medicine | |ef55bcb8fb044549c9e1f6caf79a1746d5bcf913 |Integrating the effects of climate change and caribou herbivory on vegetation community structure in low Arctic tundra |NA | | 2013| 0| 7|Environmental Science | |e9f9cdcd98050c16b38863be864732dd385eb00e |Contemporary evolution of Senecio pterophorus in Response to climate but not to herbivory |Divergence in plant traits and trait plasticity after invasion has been proposed as an important mechanism favoring invasion success. Current hypotheses predict a rapid evolution in response to changes in the abiotic conditions after invasion, or to changes in the herbivore consumption pressure caused by a decrease in the enemies associated at the area of origin (e.g.&nbsp;evolution of increased competitive ability –EICA– hypothesis). Here we have evaluated, simultaneously, the role of climate and herbivore consumption on the rapid geographical divergence in plant traits and trait plasticity of the exotic plant Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae). S. pterophorus is a perennial shrub native from Eastern South Africa and a recent invader in Western South Africa (~100 years ago), Australia (&gt;70-100 years ago) and Europe (&gt;30 years ago). In Australia it has been declared a noxious weed subject to eradication. The four distributional regions of S. pterophorus differ in their summer drought stress and in their interactions with herbivores. We performed a common garden experiment with plants sampled throughout the entire known distributional area of S. pterophorus in the native and non-native ranges to test geographical differences in individual-level traits, leaf-level traits and reproductive-level traits, and their plastic response to water availability. Native and non-native populations differed in plant traits, but not in trait plasticity, in response to their local climatic conditions. However, our results are contrary to the role of herbivory as a selective factor after invasion. | | 2014| 0| 0|Biology | |e23f8086b0ef11af7a6dd31058a4dffdba55d137 |Background insect herbivory increases with local elevation but makes minor contribution to element cycling along natural gradients in the Subarctic |Abstract Herbivores can exert major controls over biogeochemical cycling. As invertebrates are highly sensitive to temperature shifts (ectothermal), the abundances of insects in high‐latitude systems, where climate warming is rapid, is expected to increase. In subarctic mountain birch forests, research has focussed on geometrid moth outbreaks, while the contribution of background insect herbivory (BIH) to elemental cycling is poorly constrained. In northern Sweden, we estimated BIH along 9 elevational gradients distributed across a gradient in regional elevation, temperature, and precipitation to allow evaluation of consistency in local versus regional variation. We converted foliar loss via BIH to fluxes of C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) from the birch canopy to the soil to compare with other relevant soil inputs of the same elements and assessed different abiotic and biotic drivers of the observed variability. We found that leaf area loss due to BIH was ~1.6% on average. This is comparable to estimates from tundra, but considerably lower than ecosystems at lower latitudes. The C, N, and P fluxes from canopy to soil associated with BIH were 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the soil input from senesced litter and external nutrient sources such as biological N fixation, atmospheric deposition of N, and P weathering estimated from the literature. Despite the minor contribution to overall elemental cycling in subarctic birch forests, the higher quality and earlier timing of the input of herbivore deposits to soils compared to senesced litter may make this contribution disproportionally important for various ecosystem functions. BIH increased significantly with leaf N content as well as local elevation along each transect, yet showed no significant relationship with temperature or humidity, nor the commonly used temperature proxy, absolute elevation. The lack of consistency between the local and regional elevational trends calls for caution when using elevation gradients as climate proxies. |Ecology and evolution | 2020| 111| 2|Environmental Science, Medicine | |cd936cf64d6aa53a6ad7ae132159a846668e39a9 |Rapid plant evolution in response to climate, but not herbivory |Divergence in plant traits and trait plasticity after invasion has been proposed as an important mechanism favouring invasion success. Current hypotheses predict a rapid evolution in response to changes in the herbivore consumption pressure caused by a decrease in the enemies associated at the area of origin (e.g.&nbsp;evolution of increased competitive ability –EICA– hypothesis), or in the abiotic conditions after invasion. Senecio pterophorus (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrub native from Eastern South Africa and a recent invader in Western South Africa (~100 years ago), Australia (&gt;70-100 years ago) and Europe (&gt;30 years ago). A biogeographic survey covering the entire distributional area of S. pterophorus confirmed that plants from the introduced areas were subject to a lower herbivore consumption compared with plants from the native area1, as expected by the enemy release hypothesis. The four distributional regions also differed in their summer drought stress. Here we have evaluated, simultaneously, the role of herbivore consumption and climate on the rapid geographical divergence in plant traits and trait plasticity of the exotic plant S. pterophorus. We performed a common garden experiment with plants sampled throughout the entire known distributional area of S. pterophorus in the native and non-native ranges to test geographical differences in individual-level traits, leaf-level traits and reproductive-level traits, and their plastic response to water availability. Native and non-native populations of S. pterophorus differed in plant traits, but not in trait plasticity, in response to their local climatic conditions. Our results are contrary to the role of herbivory as a selective factor after invasion and highlight the importance of climate driving rapid evolution of exotic plants. | | 2014| 0| 0|Biology | |7872eb4b7bea9fff5315df1f0e1c8ff2e178a6cb |Microclimate structures communities, predation and herbivory in the High Arctic |Abstract In a warming world, changes in climate may result in species‐level responses as well as changes in community structure through knock‐on effects on ecological interactions such as predation and herbivory. Yet, the links between these responses at different levels are still inadequately understood. Assessing how microclimatic conditions affect each of them at local scales provides information essential for understanding the consequences of macroclimatic changes projected in the future. Focusing on the rapidly changing High Arctic, we examine how a community based on a common resource species (avens, Dryas spp.), a specialist insect herbivore (Sympistis zetterstedtii) and natural enemies of lepidopteran herbivores (parasitoids) varies along a multidimensional microclimatic gradient. We ask (a) how parasitoid community composition varies with local abiotic conditions, (b) how the community‐level response of parasitoids is linked to species‐specific traits (koino‐ or idiobiont life cycle strategy and phenology) and (c) whether the effects of varying abiotic conditions extend to interaction outcomes (parasitism rates on the focal herbivore and realized herbivory rates). We recorded the local communities of parasitoids, herbivory rates on Dryas flowers and parasitism rates in Sympistis larvae at 20 sites along a mountain slope. For linking community‐level responses to microclimatic conditions with parasitoid traits, we used joint species distribution modelling. We then assessed whether the same abiotic variables also affect parasitism and herbivory rates, by applying generalized linear and additive mixed models. We find that parasitism strategy and phenology explain local variation in parasitoid community structure. Parasitoids with a koinobiont strategy preferred high‐elevation sites with higher summer temperatures or sites with earlier snowmelt and lower humidity. Species of earlier phenology occurred with higher incidence at sites with cooler summer temperatures or later snowmelt. Microclimatic effects also extend to parasitism and herbivory, with an increase in the parasitism rates of the main herbivore S. zetterstedtii with higher temperature and lower humidity, and a matching increase in herbivory rates. Our results show that microclimatic variation is a strong driver of local community structure, species interactions and interaction outcomes in Arctic ecosystems. In view of ongoing climate change, these results predict that macroclimatic changes will profoundly affect arctic communities. |The Journal of animal ecology | 2020| 115| 1|Medicine | |7148a8bc288b226d134bde49baa3d83256f54845 |Changes in Planktivory and Herbivory Regimes in a Shallow South American Lake (Lake Blanca Chica, Argentina) Over the Last 250 Years |Shallow lakes are vulnerable ecosystems impacted by human activities and climate change. The Cladocera occupy a central role in food webs and are an excellent paleoecological indicator of food web structure and trophic status. We conducted a paleolimnological study in Lake Blanca Chica (Argentina) to detect changes on the planktivory and herbivory regimes over the last 250 years. Generalized additive models were fitted to the time series of fish predation indicators (ephippial abundance and size, mucrone size, fish scales, and the planktivory index) and pheophorbide a concentration. The cladoceran assemblage changed from littoral-benthic to pelagic species dominance and zooplankton switched from large-bodied (Daphnia) to small-bodied grazers (Bosmina) ca. 1900 due to increased predation. The shift in planktivory regime (ca. 1920–1930), indicated by fish scales and the planktivory index, as well as herbivory (ca. 1920–1950), was triggered by eutrophication. Changes in planktivory affected the size structure of Bosmina, reducing its body size. This study describes the baseline for the lake as well as the profound changes in the composition and size structure of the zooplankton community due to increased predation and the shift in the planktivory regime. These findings will provide a reference status for future management strategies of this ecosystem. | | 2020| 64| 1|Environmental Science | |a5e50744b453d1dc2128b40cf3daf338d3ccda06 |Temperate Kelp Forest Collapse by Fish Herbivory: A Detailed Demographic Study |Kelps dominate rocky shores in temperate latitudes, acting as important foundation species. Recently, kelp forests have received growing attention for their decline around the world. Climate change is one of the main drivers of their deforestation, both through abiotic stress and/or distortion of biotic interactions. In NW Spain, golden kelp (Laminaria ochroleuca) forests have recently declined in some areas due to excessive grazing. To further investigate the mechanisms behind this decline, a thorough 1-year seasonal demographic study was carried out on eight golden kelp reefs: four healthy and four degraded by herbivory. Kelps covered the full range of size classes throughout the year on healthy reefs. By contrast, only small, newly recruited kelps were found on degraded reefs in spring-summer, because excessive herbivory in autumn-winter caused a total collapse of kelp populations on a reef-scale (i.e., all kelps reduced to inviable stubs with no blade and no growth meristem). Bite marks in kelps covering all size classes showed that fishes, instead of invertebrates, were the culprits of the excessive herbivory. Recent studies, mostly conducted in the Indo-Pacific, also found that fish herbivory, alone or in combination with abiotic stressors, can maintain a canopy-free state in kelp reefs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that fish is also shown to cause the collapse of entire kelp forests on a reef scale in the temperate Atlantic. The implications of this finding for the management and potential recovery of degraded reefs are discussed. |Frontiers in Marine Science | 2022| 160| 0|NULL | |84b860787a3a7979538c19f40d35496c6e62378f |Effects of abiotic environment on invertebrate herbivory depend on plant community context in a montane grassland |Invertebrate herbivores are important and diverse, and their abundance and impacts are expected to undergo unprecedented shifts under climate change. Yet, past studies of invertebrate herbivory have documented a wide variety of responses to changing temperature, making it challenging to predict the direction and magnitude of these shifts. One explanation for these idiosyncratic responses is that changing environmental conditions may drive concurrent changes in plant communities and herbivore traits. Thus, the impacts of changing temperature on herbivory might depend on how temperature combines and interacts with characteristics of plant communities and the herbivores that occupy them. Here, we test this hypothesis by surveying invertebrate herbivory in 220, 0.5 meter-diameter herbaceous plant communities along a 1101-meter elevational gradient. Our results suggest that increasing temperature can drive community-level herbivory via at least three overlapping mechanisms: increasing temperature directly reduced herbivory, indirectly affected herbivory by reducing phylogenetic diversity of the plant community, and indirectly affected herbivory by altering the effects of functional and phylogenetic diversity on herbivory. Consequently, increasing functional diversity of plant communities had a negative effect on herbivory, but only in colder environments while a positive effect of increasing phylogenetic diversity was observed in warmer environments. Moreover, accounting for differences among herbivore feeding guilds considerably improved model fit, because different herbivore feeding guilds varied in their response to temperature and plant community composition. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering both plant and herbivore community context in order to predict how climate change will alter invertebrate herbivory. |bioRxiv | 2022| 107| 0|Biology | |c5e6e5f4998bc15879c3b0173993a876b00e1e2f |Do experimental drought stress and species’ drought sensitivity influence herbivory in tropical tree seedlings? |In tropical forests, drought and herbivory represent two potent stresses on seedlings. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of severe droughts in many tropical forests, which may influence seedling vulnerability to herbivores if drought stress affects seedling palatability. Furthermore, contrasting selective pressures in wetter vs drier forests could mean that species well‐adapted to herbivores are less drought resistant and vice versa. In this study, we measured seedling performance and herbivory in a common garden experiment where seedlings of 15 tree species were subjected to irrigation or rainfall exclusion treatments across two dry seasons in Panama. Water manipulation had no effects on foliar herbivory during the experiment for all species combined and for 14 of the 15 focal species when analyzed separately. There was large variation among species in herbivore damage, but no relationship between the sensitivity of species to drought and the amount of herbivory they experienced. Altogether, our findings suggest that increasing drought stress is unlikely to directly alter tropical tree seedling susceptibility to herbivore attack in this forest. Additional studies are needed to determine whether drought alters tropical plant‐herbivore interactions via other mechanisms, such as through changes in herbivorous insect communities and/or increases in fitness costs of herbivory. |Biotropica | 2022| 51| 0|NULL | |846f66ca70015a8435d9f08fafbf859251a4521f |Herbivory in Liolaemus poecilochromus, a Small, Cold-Climate Lizard from the Andes of Argentina |Herbivory is generally thought to be restricted to reptiles with large body sizes that live in warm climates. We show that Liolaemus poecilochromus is primarily herbivorous (&gt;80% plants in diet) even as juveniles, making them the smallest herbivorous reptile known. We detected relatively few differences in diet between the sexes, despite male-biased sexual dimorphism in head and body size. Adults consumed more mites and flowers than juveniles, and we detected a weak ontogenetic shift from omnivory to herbivory that is attributable to the lower volumetric consumption of plants by juvenile males. We discuss the abiotic and biotic conditions that likely selected for herbivory in this and other small-bodied, high-elevation Liolaemus. Herbivoría en general se cree que se limita a los reptiles con cuerpos grandes que viven en climas cálidos. Mostramos que Liolaemus poecilochromus es principalmente herbívora (&gt;80% de plantas en la dieta) incluso los juveniles, convirtiéndolo por esto en el reptil herbívoro más pequeño conocido. Asimismo, detectamos pocas diferencias en la dieta entre los sexos, a pesar del dimorfismo sexual a favor de los machos en el tamaño de la cabeza y el cuerpo. Los adultos consumen más ácaros y flores que los juveniles, por otro lado se detectó un cambio ontogenético débil de omnivoria a herbivoría en los machos juveniles, debido a su bajo consumo de plantas.

Herbivory and plant quality along. European elevational gradients |This thesis describes the effect of elevation on the abundance of forest insects along steep mountain slopes, to be used as a spatial analogue of climate change. The elevational gradients in different places in Europe were used as a proxy for the temperature change, using the lapse rate of 0.6 °C every 100 m. Elevational gradients provide an optimal experimental setting to test the relationship between temperature variation and herbivory. Direct and indirect (through the host plant and by the natural enemies) effects of the temperature were checked. The tree quality was measured by leaf toughness, leaf size, C/N ratio, tree diameter and height and, for cone and seed insects, by the length of cones. Insect herbivores were taken into account because they are amongst the most important primary consumers of forest ecosystem, even when they are studied at endemic density as in the present study. The response to the changing temperature was checked for insects guilds (leaf sap feeder, chewers, gall makers, miners) in the Chapter 2, for selected insect species like pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Chapter 3, and also for cone and seed insects of Norway spruce (Cydia strobilella, Dioryctria abietella, Ernobius abietis, Strobilomyia anthracina) in Chapter 4. We concentrated on four main European tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris) because they are the most important trees regarding their abundance and economy value. In the Chapter 1 we used a large data set where we measured leaf herbivory and leaf traits along steep elevational gradients in different biogeographical regions of Europe. We found either neutral or positive effect of increasing temperatures on herbivory while no clear effect of biotic interactions emerged. Among guilds, chewers and leaf miners responded more often than sap feeders and gall makers to temperature. The response to temperature of different host species varied strongly, with conifers more sensitive than broadleaves (Fagus sylvatica). There was a clear elevational pattern of toughness and leaf size (except for Larix decidua) but leaf traits were almost never related with changes in herbivory. There was not interaction between the herbivory guilds except for the miners and chewers of Larix decidua. This community approach (like dividing the insect species into the guilds) is, however, crucial to help understanding the ecosystem level response of insect herbivory to temperature.</p>
<p>In the Chapter 3 the abundance of the nests of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) along two elevational gradients in southern Spain (Sierra Nevada mountains) was considered. The number of nests increased with elevation, which is opposite to what was expected. Possible explanatory factors were searched in stand conditions (tree density, host percentage), tree quality (tree height, needle toughness, C/N ratio, needle length), egg parasitoids, and possible competitors (leaf sap feeders and chewers). Winter temperature did not explain moth abundance, which was in turn explained by tree height, leaf C/N, but mainly by a higher realized fecundity at high elevation, likely linked to better growth conditions, and by higher egg parasitism at lower elevation. In Chapter 4 the colonization of Norway spruce mature cones by cone and seed insects was analyzed along four alpine elevational gradients (three in Italy, one in France). Specialised insects feeding on seeds (Cydia strobilella and Strobilomyia antracina) did not respond to temperature whereas generalits species feeding on cone tissues did (Dioryctria abietella and Ernobius abietis). There was also a significant interaction, as the seed feeder Cydia strobilella affected positively the generalists Dioryctria abietella and Ernobius abietis. Generally, all chapters based on the elevational gradient approach provided results useful to better understand the effect of future climate change on insect herbivores, although many of the interactions among elevation, host plant, and insects are still to unveil | | 2012| 49| 2|Biology | |4df6bcc517b75bc560c50e42e7d67a242d3415dd |Population Variation, Environmental Gradients, and the Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Defense against Herbivory |A central tenet of plant defense theory is that adaptation to the abiotic environment sets the template for defense strategies, imposing a trade-off between plant growth and defense. Yet this trade-off, commonly found among species occupying divergent resource environments, may not occur across populations of single species. We hypothesized that more favorable climates and higher levels of herbivory would lead to increases in growth and defense across plant populations. We evaluated whether plant growth and defense traits covaried across 18 populations of showy milkweed (Asclepias speciosa) inhabiting an east-west climate gradient spanning 25° of longitude. A suite of traits impacting defense (e.g., latex, cardenolides), growth (e.g., size), or both (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA], trichomes) were measured in natural populations and in a common garden, allowing us to evaluate plastic and genetically based variation in these traits. In natural populations, herbivore pressure increased toward warmer sites with longer growing seasons. Growth and defense traits showed strong clinal patterns and were positively correlated. In a common garden, clines with climatic origin were recapitulated only for defense traits. Correlations between growth and defense traits were also weaker and more negative in the common garden than in the natural populations. Thus, our data suggest that climatically favorable sites likely facilitate the evolution of greater defense at minimal costs to growth, likely because of increased resource acquisition. |The American Naturalist | 2019| 93| 44|Medicine, Biology | |18ca32e171e04303c63e3b688ffa734840b6c025 |Combined effects of drought stress and psyllid herbivory on the invasive weed Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius |Increases in the frequency and duration of droughts under global climate change could have implications for plant–insect interactions, and could either increase or decrease the effects of weed biological control agents. In this study, we used greenhouse and field experiments to examine the impacts of drought stress on the abundance and impacts of the adventive psyllid Arytainilla spartiophila Forster (Hemiptera: Psyllidae, Arytaininae) on its target weed Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link (Fabaceae), in California, USA. The psyllid impacted plant growth in both field and greenhouse experiments, whereas drought stress affected plant growth in the greenhouse only, suggesting that other factors besides water availability may be more limiting for plants in the field. Effects on psyllid survival were consistent with the plant vigor hypothesis, which predicts that herbivores will perform better on vigorously growing plants; psyllid numbers were lower on drought‐stressed plants in the greenhouse and were correlated with plant growth in both the greenhouse and the field. In the greenhouse, the combined effects of the psyllid and drought stress were additive, indicating that the effects of the psyllid were consistent across unstressed and drought‐stressed plants. Although the psyllid is unlikely to control Scotch broom on its own, results suggest that it may work in conjunction with drought stress to suppress Scotch broom. | | 2020| 54| 2|Biology | |858eaf439d2a3d45a0a5ac90eb54d7e89008740d |High herbivory despite high sediment loads on a fringing coral reef |NA |Coral Reefs | 2022| 67| 1|NULL | |4ad0f35bd4f29aa3c3e4e8ab084cd8d450fff3ad |Phase Shifts, Herbivory, and the Resilience of Coral Reefs to Climate Change |NA |Current Biology | 2007| 34| 1357|Biology , Medicine | |5894162b15f2c849b3ba7bab08d74379a66dd649 |Flood‐stimulated herbivory drives range retraction of a plant ecosystem |Climate change is generating extreme climate events, affecting ecosystem integrity and function directly through increases in abiotic stress and disturbance and indirectly through changes in the strength of biotic interactions. As consumers play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate conditions, improved understanding of their role under changing environmental conditions is necessary to accurately anticipate climate change impacts on ecosystem integrity. We evaluated if prolonged periods of extreme rain, a climatic event increasing in severity in many places around the world, and coincident increases in coastal flooding duration intensify consumer control of foundational salt marsh grass structure and quantify the consequences of flooding–consumer interactions on salt marsh range extent. To achieve this, we analysed: historic trends in crab grazing; crab numbers and activity in and out of rainy years on the low marsh edge; vegetation retreat from the low marsh edge at a plot scale in a manipulative exclosure experiment; vegetation retreat at a landscape‐scale from drone image analyses; and the vertical erosion in the lowest edge of an Argentinean salt marsh. During flooded periods, crabs congregated in the low marsh, resulting in localized overgrazing of salt marsh grass and the rapid horizontal retreat of the marsh edge (98.5 cm on average). Salt marsh edge retreat resulted in a loss of ~4.5% of the total marsh area at the landscape scale. Inside crab exclusion plots, although grass cover declined slightly during the study period, the marsh edge did not retreat. Synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence that an extreme climate event can destabilize a local consumer–prey interaction, indirectly triggering the range contraction of a critical coastal habitat. This work contributes to a growing body of research demonstrating that consumers can be unleashed, rather than suppressed, by extreme climatic events. Moreover, in cases where consumer fronts form during such events, the result can be not only local (along habitat edges) but also landscape‐scale extinction of foundation species and the habitats they biogenically create. Together, this supports the general idea that models of future climate scenarios integrate the indirect effects on ecosystem‐regulating food web interactions. |Journal of Ecology | 2020| 97| 1|Environmental Science | |a88cc680552cb260904835e17d002b7e82bae2c6 |Herbivory changes soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas fluxes in a high-latitude wetland |NA |Microbial ecology | 2021| 49| 2|Medicine | |2c4b4eb2522f02eab0eef1a587c32dec5bf2f789 |SHIFTING HERBIVORY PATTERN DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A CASE STUDY OF HIMALAYAN BALSAM FROM PAKISTAN |Pests, diseases and weeds cause significant impact on crops and natural vegetation each year.

One of nature’s most prolific such radiations, Liolaemus lizards, has diversified across the extreme cold climates of the Andes and Patagonia. Remarkably, the prevailing patterns of reptile herbivory are opposed by Liolaemus which, in contrast with lizards generally, have repeatedly evolved plant consumption across small-bodied species from cold climates. Herbivory is hypothesized to depend on the evolution of multiple traits that maximize absorption of nutrients from an intrinsically poor-quality diet, such as increases in gastrointestinal tract size and increases in the density of nematodes in the intestine that may assist with plant digestion. Here, a comparative phylogenetic approach across Liolaemus species is implemented to test these hypotheses, which have only been investigated nonphylogenetically. Results reveal that intestine length increases consistently with increasing herbivory, whereas stomach size or nematode load are not associated with plant consumption. Body size plays no role in herbivory either. Consequently, this evidence places emphasis on the enlargement of the intestine to facilitate the evolution of herbivory in cold climates. | | 2021| 0| 1|Biology | |10171103402847443c5260718312d1f2ba853867 |Herbivory and Soil Water Availability Induce Changes in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Abundance and Composition. |NA |Microbial ecology | 2021| 50| 1|Medicine | |5bcace94d009dafdb33893f01fa18f0c707b4ea1 |Dual benefit of ocean acidification for the laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima: enhanced growth and reduced herbivory |The laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima is a common macroalga along rocky shorelines that is also frequently used in aquaculture. This study examined how ocean acidification may alter the growth of S. latissima as well as grazing on S. latissima by the gastropod Lacuna vincta. Under elevated nutrients, S. latissima experienced significantly enhanced growth at pCO2 levels ≥1200 μatm compared to ambient pCO2 (~400 μatm). Elevated pCO2 (≥830 μatm) also significantly reduced herbivory of L. vincta grazing on S. latissima relative to ambient pCO2. There was no difference in grazing of S. latissima previously grown under elevated or ambient pCO2, suggesting lowered herbivory was due to harm to the gastropods rather than alteration of the biochemical composition of the kelp. Decreased herbivory was specifically elicited when L. vincta were exposed to elevated pCO2 in the absence of food for ≥18 h prior to grazing, with reduced grazing persisting 72 h. Elevated growth of S. latissima and reduced grazing by L. vincta at 1200 μatm pCO2 combined to increase net growth rates of S. latissima more than 4-fold relative to ambient pCO2. L. vincta consumed 70% of daily production by S. latissima under ambient pCO2 but only 38 and 9% at 800 and 1200 μatm, respectively. Collectively, decreased grazing by L. vincta coupled with enhanced growth of S. latissima under elevated pCO2 demonstrates that increased CO2 associated with climate change and/or coastal processes will dually benefit commercially and ecologically important kelps by both promoting growth and reducing grazing pressure. | | 2021| 84| 1|Environmental Science | |9c89b12fee979fc06a2422b37ede9ec0af041f0b |The effects of atmospheric composition, climate, and herbivory on plant secondary metabolism and volatile organic carbon emissions |Quantifying the biosynthesis and emission of terpenes by plants is necessary to understand ecological interactions and improve global atmospheric models. Many studies have addressed the importance of individual factors influencing terpene production and release into the atmosphere, but few have investigated complex interactions between multiple variables and the resulting chemistry’s effects on interactions between organisms across multiple trophic levels. To address this gap in our knowledge, I conducted a series of experiments to examine abiotic and biotic controls over terpene synthesis and emission in Poplar x canescens and Pinus edulis, in which terpenes play prominent roles in plant physiological protection (isoprene) and defense (monoterpenes). Increases in atmospheric CO2 resulted in a smaller contribution of stored extrachloroplastic carbon towards isoprene biosynthesis and a larger investment from recently assimilated carbon in poplar. In addition to climate change scenarios, it is also critical to understand how abiotic and biotic processes affect terpene concentrations and emissions in situ. Tiger moth herbivory increased pinyon pine monoterpene fluxes three to six fold during spring feeding, but summer drought decreased emissions while maintaining high levels of foliar concentrations. Following a release from drought stress, previously damaged pinyon pines exhibited significantly higher emission rates, potentially due to a drought delayed stimulation of induced monoterpene synthesis.

Both are plant consumers that can strongly control the recruitment of woody seedlings and saplings to taller height classes. Without consumer control, many grass‐dominated ecosystems would convert into woodlands or forests. While extensively studied in savannas, few have explored the effects of these disturbance regimes on woody recruitment under temperate conditions. We exposed saplings of five common European tree species to fire and herbivory in a full factorial experiment in a savanna‐like wood‐pasture. After 3 years, we evaluated the effects of fire and herbivory on tree sapling survival and height increment. The tree species used, varying in traits and in expected response to fire and herbivory, were Scots pine Pinus sylvestris, Norway spruce Picea abies, European oak Quercus robur, Silver birch Betula pendula and Small‐leaved lime Tilia cordata. Fire and herbivory had a negative effect on sapling survival for all species except for Q. robur, which was not affected by fire. Both processes reduced height increment of B. pendula, while only herbivory reduced the height increment of P. sylvestris and Q. robur. At the same time, B. pendula and P. sylvestris had some of the highest increments, together with P. abies, which had unaffected height increment in all treatments. T. cordata, on the other hand, had a negative height increment across all treatments. Overall, the combined effect of fire and herbivory was similar to the effect of herbivory alone on both survival and height increment, indicating no additional effect of fire when herbivores were present. Synthesis. Our experiment showed how fire and herbivory can strongly affect the recruitment of European temperate tree saplings on a wood‐pasture, potentially leading to comparable consumer control described for ecosystems elsewhere (e.g.&nbsp;savannas). Two strategies to deal with fire and herbivory were identified: tolerance (Q. robur) and avoidance (P. sylvestris and B. pendula). We conclude that both fire and herbivory may have been important drivers of structure and species composition in open ecosystems in temperate Europe in the past. |Journal of Ecology | 2021| 0| 0|Environmental Science | |623d372d6c6cf8304cca1692ad934938b6d1f249 |The ZAX Herbivory Trainer—Free software for training researchers to visually estimate leaf damage |Plants lose a remarkable amount of energy to herbivorous animals, and this damage has substantial impacts on plant fitness and species’ distributions. There are many ways ecologists can measure leaf damage, with some methods being more time‐consuming than others. Due to a high variance in herbivory, accurate quantification of damage at the population level requires sampling of many leaves. A simple yet effective solution to this problem is to estimate leaf damage visually. Visually estimating leaf damage may be less accurate than scanning methods, but visual estimates of leaf damage are much faster than digital measurements. Using simulations, we show that gathering larger quantities of data at a slightly higher level of inaccuracy gives a more accurate estimate of a population’s overall leaf damage than fewer, exact measurements. We then introduce the ZAX Herbivory Trainer, a free online application that teaches researchers to accurately visually estimate leaf damage. On average, users took ~9 min and 48 images to complete our trainer which significantly decreased their estimate inaccuracy from 13.2% to 6%. This low level of inaccuracy can be retained up to 3 months post‐training so researchers can use the ZAX Herbivory Trainer once prior to short fieldwork or every 3 months for extensive fieldwork. We also recommend a cut‐off point, whereby if a person has not completed the app in 17.5 min or 85 images (90th percentile), they may not be suitable to estimate herbivory for research purposes. The ZAX Herbivory Trainer will allow researchers of any experience level to assess herbivory quickly and accurately in a globally standardised way. International collaborators, students and citizen scientists can all find use in this app, no matter the scale of their projects. From this we can gather better data to address big picture questions in ecology such as patterns in herbivory relating to latitude or climate change. |Methods in Ecology and Evolution | 2021| 41| 0|NULL | |8208dead4789e69148a553e102530ac52e61fbc8 |Ungulate herbivory modifies the effects of climate change on mountain forests |NA | | 2011| 63| 41|Environmental Science | |1ab15bbfc0c912fcf805ceb5b60c62a6e40b57cd |Ecological interactions mediate projected loss of kelp biomass under climate change |Climate change has precipitated loss of kelp in temperate regions globally, with further losses projected in response to ocean warming. Projected climate‐driven changes to kelp are commonly derived from responses to sea surface temperature and neglect the effects of important ecological interactions, such as herbivory. Here, we use a stacked species distribution model to project impacts of future climate scenarios on kelp distribution and biomass incorporating the effects of key ecological interactions. |Diversity and Distributions | 2021| 51| 1|NULL | |88caa8935016636c578bf00f8e57b5c8950e6afc |Climate change alters plant-herbivore interactions. |Plant-herbivore interactions have evolved in response to co-evolutionary dynamics, along with selection driven by abiotic conditions. We examine how abiotic factors influence trait expression in both plants and herbivores to evaluate how climate change will alter this long-standing interaction. The paleontological record documents increased herbivory during periods of global warming in the deep past. In phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses, we find that elevated temperatures, CO2 concentration, drought stress and nutrient conditions directly and indirectly induce greater herbivore consumption, primarily in agricultural systems. Additionally, elevated CO2 delays herbivore development, but increased temperatures accelerate development. For annual plants, higher temperatures, CO2 , and drought stress increase foliar herbivory, and our meta-analysis suggests that greater temperatures and drought may heighten florivory in perennials. Human actions are causing concurrent shifts in CO2 , temperature, precipitation regimes and nitrogen deposition, yet few studies evaluate interactions among these changing conditions. We call for additional multifactorial studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple climatic factors, which will enable us to generate more robust predictions of how climate change could disrupt plant-herbivore interactions. Finally, we consider how shifts in insect and plant phenology and distribution patterns could lead to ecological mismatches, and how these changes may drive future adaptation and coevolution between interacting species. |The New phytologist | 2020| 184| 30|Medicine, Biology |</p>
