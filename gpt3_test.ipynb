The refrigerant is why an air source heat pump is sometimes called a \\\"refrigerant heat pump.\\\"\\n\\nThe air source heat pump has two main components: an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. The outdoor unit contains the compressor, while the indoor unit contains the evaporator.\\n\\nThe working principle of an air source heat pump is fairly simple. In the winter, the outdoor unit sucks in air from the outside and sends it to the compressor. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, which causes it to heat up. The refrigerant then travels to the indoor unit, where it passes through the coil.\\n\\nThe indoor unit also contains a fan that blows air over the coil, which heats up the air and blows it into the room. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump extracts heat from the air inside the home and transfers it outside.\"\n",

Oxygen levels began to rise some 650 million years ago or even earlier (coinciding with the Metazoan stage); plants, animals, and fungi emerged on land perhaps 480 million years ago; forests appeared around 370 million years ago; and modern groups such as mammals, birds, reptiles, and land plants originated about 200 million years ago. The geological record shows that there have been five global mass extinction events, the first of them about 540 million years ago. The records also suggest that 99% of the species that have ever existed (perhaps 5 billion in number) have become extinct. The last major extinction event occurred about 66 million years ago, and the number of species on Earth and the complexity of their communities and ecosystems have increased steadily since that time.10 Over the past 66 million years, the number of species has grown to around 8 million to 20 million (possibly more) species of eukaryotic organisms – ones with cells that have a distinct nucleus – and an unknown and much larger number of prokaryotes (Archaea and bacteria). Our lack of knowledge is enormous. Only about 1% of the species that have existed during the history of life on Earth live in the ecosystems into which humans evolved and live now. From the time that human beings evolved, our dependency on biodiversity, that is, the diversity of life, has remained complete. Indeed, we ourselves are a part of biodiversity.\"\n",
