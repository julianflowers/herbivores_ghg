Abstract 

Simulation models are one of the  approaches used to investigate  greenhouse 

gas  emissions  and  potential  effects  of  global  warming  on  terrestrial  ecosystems. 

DayCent  which  is  the  daily  time-step  version  of  the  CENTURY  biogeochemical 

model,  and  DNDC  (the  DeNitrification-DeComposition  model)  were  tested  against 

observed  nitrous  oxide  flux  data  from  a  field  experiment  on  cut  and  extensively 

grazed pasture located at the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre, Co. Carlow, Ireland. 

The soil was classified as a free draining sandy clay loam soil with a pH of 7.3 and a 
mean organic carbon and nitrogen content at 0-20 cm of 38 and 4.4 g kg-1 dry soil, 
respectively. The aims of this study were to validate DayCent and DNDC models for 

estimating  N2O  emissions  from  fertilized  humid  pasture,  and  to  investigate  the 
impacts  of  future  climate  change  on  N2O  fluxes  and  biomass  production. 
Measurements of N2O flux were carried out from November 2003 to November 2004 
using static chambers. Three climate scenarios, a baseline of measured climatic data 

from  the  weather  station  at  Carlow,  and  high  and  low  temperature  sensitivity 

scenarios predicted by the Community Climate Change Consortium For Ireland (C4I) 

based  on 

the  Hadley  Centre  Global  Climate  Model 

(HadCM3)  and 

the 

Intergovernment  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  A1B  emission  scenario  were 
investigated. DayCent predicted cumulative N2O flux and biomass production under 
fertilized  grass  with  relative  deviations  of  +38%  and  (-23%)  from  the  measured, 

respectively.  However,  DayCent  performs  poorly  under  the  control  plots,  with  flux 

relative deviation of (-57%) from the measured. Comparison between simulated and

measured  flux  suggests  that  both  DayCent  model’s  response  to  N  fertilizer  and 

simulated  background  flux  need  to  be  adjusted.  DNDC  overestimated  the  measured 

flux with  relative deviations of +132 and +258% due to overestimation of the effects 

of  SOC.  DayCent,  though  requiring  some  calibration  for  Irish  conditions,  simulated 

N2O fluxes more consistently than did DNDC. We used DayCent to estimate future 
fluxes  of  N2O  from  this  field.  No  significant  differences  were  found  between 
cumulative N2O flux under climate change and baseline conditions. However, above-
ground grass biomass was significantly increased from the baseline of 33 t ha-1 to 45 
(+34%) and 50 (+48%) t dry matter ha-1 for the low and high temperature sensitivity 
scenario respectively. The increase in above-ground grass biomass was mainly due to 

the  overall  effects  of  high  precipitation,  temperature  and  CO2  concentration.  Our 
results  indicate  that  because  of  high  N  demand  by  the  vigorously  growing  grass, 

cumulative N2O flux is not projected to increase significantly under climate change, 
unless more N is applied. This was observed for both the high and low temperature 

sensitivity scenarios.

1. Introduction 

Nitrous Oxide (N2O), on a kg to kg basis, has a global warming potential of 
approximately 298-310 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100 year timescale 
(Watson et al., 1996; IPCC, 2007) with an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 120 

years (Prather, 1998). The concentration of N2O in the atmosphere has risen from a 
pre-industrial level of about 270 ppb to 319 ppb in 2005, and is estimated to be rising 

at  a  rate  of  0.8  ppb  per  annum  (IPCC,  2007).  According  to  the  IPCC  (2001;  2007) 

N2O is responsible for about 6% of the anthropogenic component of radiative forcing.  
 

The  complex  interaction  of  microbiological  processes  and  soil  conditions, 

such  as  water  content,  carbon  (C)  and  nitrogen  (N)  content,  temperature  and  pH 

regulates  N2O  dynamics  in  the  soil  profile,  and  determines  how  and  when  N2O  is 
released  from  the  soil  surface  (Granli  and  Bockman,  1994).  Management  practices 

such as soil tillage, crop type, and the application of nitrogen fertilizers influence the 

physical  and  hydrological  condition  of  the  soil  and  the  timing  and  distribution  of 

nutrient  inputs.  This  in  turn  affects  the  size,  composition  and  activity  of  the  soil

microbial population, and therefore, the extent of N2O production and emission from 
agricultural soils. 

Worldwide,  agricultural  soils,  particularly  grazed  pastures,  are  the  major 

single source of N2O emissions contributing approximately 46 to 52% of the global 
anthropogenic N2O flux (Mosier et al., 1998; Olivier et al., 1998; Kroeze et al., 1999; 
IPCC,  2007).  In  Europe,  grasslands  are  the  major  contributor  to  the  exchange  of 

greenhouse  gases  in  the  biosphere,  with  fluxes  intimately  linked  to  management 

practices.  In  Europe,  about  40%  of  the  agricultural  area  is  covered  by  permanent 

grassland used for livestock farming (FAO, 2004). Grasslands range from intensively 

fertilized pure grass swards to extensively managed grass-legume mixtures and semi-

natural grasslands, which are often found in mountainous areas or on moist lowland 

soils (FAO, 2004). In Ireland, about 80% of the agricultural area and 58% of the total 

land  area  is  grassland  (Teagasc,  2010;  CSO  Census  of  Agriculture,  2010).  This 

includes grazed pasture, silage, hay meadows and rough grazing areas.  

Changes in the exchange of greenhouse  gases between  grassland ecosystems 

and the atmosphere may significantly impact on global climate change. Consequently, 
the increase in  global mean  annual temperature,  predicted to be 1.5-4.5  oC over the 
next 50-100 years, will dramatically affect terrestrial ecosystems (IPCC, 2007). Most 

biological and chemical soil processes are strongly dependent on temperature (Shaver 

et al., 2000) including decomposition (Shaw and Harte, 2001), N mineralization and 

nitrification  (Stark  and  Firestone,  1996),  nutrients  uptake  (BassiriRad,  2000),  and 

consequently emissions of CO2, N2O and methane (CH4) (Malhi et al.,  1990; Raich 
and Schlesinger, 1992; Abdalla et al., 2009a) respond to temperature.  

The  DayCent  (Daily  Century)  and  DNDC  (DeNitrification-DeComposition) 

models  are  two  widely-used  ecosystem  biogeochemistry  models  used  to  estimate 

greenhouse  gas emissions. The DayCent model is the daily time-step version of the 

CENTURY biogeochemical model (Parton et al., 1994). Comparison of model results 

and  observed  data  have  shown  that  DayCent  reliably  simulates  crop  yield,  SOM 

levels, and trace-gas flux for various native and managed systems (Del Grosso et al., 

2002; Del Grosso et al., 2009). The DNDC model was developed to assess N2O, NO, 
N2 and CO2 emissions from agricultural soils (Li et al., 1992, Li 2000). The rainfall 
driven  process-based  model  DNDC  (Li  et  al.,  1992)  was  originally  developed  for

States (Li et al., 1996), China (Li et al., 2001), Canada (Smith et al., 2010) and Europe 

(Kesik et al., 2006). This study is part of an ongoing research programme to measure 

and model N2O flux from Irish agriculture (Abdalla et al., 2009a, b and c). The aims 
of  this  study  were  to  validate  the  DayCent  and  DNDC  models  for  estimating  N2O 
emissions  from  fertilized  humid  grassland  in  the  midlands  of  Ireland,  and  to 

investigate the effect of future climate change on N2O fluxes and biomass production.  

2. Materials and methods 

2.1 Field experimental site 

A detailed description of the study site can be found in Abdalla et al. (2009a, 
b). It is located at the Oak Park Research Centre in Carlow 52o 86′ N and 6o 54′ W, 
Ireland. The site area  (≈ 7 ha) has an elevation of 56 m a.s.l, a mean annual rainfall of 
824 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 9.4 oC. The soil is classified as a sandy 
clay loam with a pH of 7.3 and a mean organic carbon and nitrogen content at 0-20 
cm  of  38,  and  4.4  g  kg-1  dry  soil,  respectively.  The  pasture  has  been  permanent 
grassland  for  at  least  the  last  80  years,  but  was  ploughed  and  reseeded  in  October 

2001 with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L., cv Cashel) at a density of 13.5 kg 
ha-1 and white clover (Trifolium repens L., cv Aran) at a density of 3.4 kg ha-1. 
 

Silage  cutting  took  place  once  during  the  experimental  period  on  15th  May 
2004 and  extensive cattle  grazing was from July to November 2003,  and then from 
July to November 2004 with a stocking rate of 2 cattle ha-1. Nitrogen in the form of 
calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) was applied at a rate of 200 kg N ha-1 y-1 in two 
applications  of  128  and  72  kg  N  ha-1  on  the  2nd  of  April  and  27th  of  May  2004, 
respectively. Grazing and cutting took place on  the whole  field for both the control 

and  the  fertilized  plots.  Nitrous  oxide  fluxes  were  measured  from  four  replicated 

chambers on the control plots and four replicated chambers on the fertilized plots. 

2.2 Field N2O fluxes and grass biomass  

Measurements  of  N2O  flux  were  carried  out  from  November  2003  to 
November 2004. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured using the methodology of Smith 

et al. (1995). Large chambers were made from steel and painted with white paint on 

the  outside  and  black  paint  on  the  inside  to  prevent  interior  heating.  Chambers

consisted of two parts: a 52 x 52 x 15 cm3 square collar inserted permanently into the 
soil over which a 50 x 50 x 30 cm3 lid with a plastic septum could be sealed in place 
for gas sample collection. To reduce spatial variation caused by excreta patches, we 

chose a part of the field which was deemed to be representative of the whole field, and 
used four replicated large static chambers that covered 0.25 m2 at a distance of 100 m 
apart.  Previous  studies  on  grassland  fields  of  similar  size  used  3–4  replicated 

chambers to measure N2O fluxes (Flechard et al., 2007; Allard et al., 2007).  

After the lids were in place an initial gas sample was taken and a second was 

taken  at  60  minutes.    Linearity  was  checked  by  sampling  each  half  an  hour  for  a 

closure period of 3 hours. In order to cover most of the year we sampled every week, 

and more intensively (twice a week) following fertilizer application. Previous studies 

of  N2O  fluxes  using  static  chambers  have  sampled  at  frequencies  ranging  from  one 
hour to two weeks (Mogge et al., 1999; Choudhary et al., 2002; Simek et al., 2004; 

Flechard  et  al.,  2007).  Samples  were  taken  in  the  morning  between  9  and  11  am. 

Samples were taken using a 60 ml gas-tight syringe after flushing of the syringe 3-4 

times in the chamber to ensure adequate mixing of air within the chamber. All 60 ml 

of the sample was then injected into a 3 ml gas-tight vial with a vent needle inserted 

into  the  top  of  the  vial  to  allow  the  extra  air  flush  out.  N2O  concentrations  were 
measured using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC 14B, Kyoto, Japan) with electron 
capture  detection  (column  and  detector  temperatures  were  30  and  300  oC 
respectively). The nitrous oxide standard was a 1 +/- 0.02 ppm N2O in synthetic air. A 
calibration series was made by proportional dilution of the standard with pure N2. The 
daily flux rate for each chamber and the average daily flux rate for the four replicates 

were calculated using the closed flux chamber technique equation (Smith et al., 1995; 

Baggs  et  al.,  2003).  Aboveground  biomass  samples  were  harvested  each  1-2  weeks 

from four circular rings of 50 cm diameter.

 2.3. Models descriptions 

The DayCent model is the daily time step version of the CENTURY (Parton et 

al.,  1994)  biogeochemical  model.  DayCent  (DelGrosso  et  al.,  2001;  Parton  et  al., 

1998) simulates fluxes of C and N between the atmosphere, vegetation, and soil. Plant 

growth is controlled by nutrient availability, water, and temperature. Nutrient supply 

is  a  function  of  soil  organic  matter  (SOM)  decomposition  and  external  nutrient

additions.  Daily  maximum/minimum  temperature  and  precipitation,  timing  and 

description of management events and soil texture data are needed as model inputs. 

Key  sub-models  include  plant  production,  SOM  decomposition,  soil  water  and 

temperature by layer, nitrification and denitrification, and CH4 oxidation. Comparison 
of model results and plot data has shown that DayCent reliably simulates crop yield, 

SOM levels, and trace gases (Li et al., 2005; DelGrosso et al., 2009). 

In this study the DNDC model (version 8.9; http://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu/) was 

applied.  DNDC  contains  four  main  sub-models  (Li  et  al.,  1992;  Li,  2000);  the  soil 

climate sub-model calculates hourly and daily soil temperature and moisture fluxes in 

one dimension, the crop growth sub-model simulates crop biomass accumulation and 

partitioning,  the  decomposition  sub-model  calculates  decomposition,  nitrification, 

NH3 volatilization and CO2 production, whilst the denitrification sub-model tracks the 
-, NO, N2O and N2 based 
sequential biochemical reduction from nitrate (NO3) to NO2
on soil redox potential and dissolved organic carbon. 

Measured values of meteorological parameters and land management records 

were  used  as  input  variables  to  the  DayCent  and  DNDC  models  (Abdalla  et  al., 

2009a). Field N2O flux data were used for DayCent and DNDC models validations by 
comparing measured and predicted N2O fluxes. The models accuracies were evaluated 
by  calculating  the  Root  Mean  Square  Error  (RMSE)  and  relative  deviation  (RD) 

between observed and DayCent/DNDC out puts.  

RMSE = (Σ(modelled − observed)2/N)1/2                                                             (1) 
RD = (modelled – observed)/observed x 100                                                        (2) 
where N is the number of data series. Annual cumulative flux for models outputs were 

calculated as the sum of simulated daily fluxes (Cai et al., 2003). Soil properties and 

climate input data of both models are summarized in Table 1.  

2.4. Climate scenarios 

The future climate data used in this research were statistically downscaled by 

the  Irish National Meteorological Service Research Group (C4I, 2008) based on the 

Hadley  Centre  Global  Climate  Model  (HadCM3)  and  the  emission  scenario  (A1B) 
published  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (Nakicenovic  and 

Swart, 2000; IPCC, 2001). Two different temperature sensitivity scenarios (high and

low)  were  investigated  to  estimate  the  uncertainty  in  future  climate  (Collins  et  al., 

2006). A regional climate model, known as RCA3, was applied to the HadCM3 data in 
a  process  which  is  known  as  dynamic  downscaling.  RCA3  is  based  on  a  model 
initially developed by the Rossby Centre and further developed by the C4I project at 

Met  Éireann.  The  resultant  model  data  has  a  horizontal  resolution  of  25  km.  A  full 

description is given in the C4I (2008) report. 

 

The baseline scenario is a measured daily climate data set (1961-1990) from a 

nearby  weather  station  in  Carlow.  The  two  future  climate  scenarios  (high  and  low 

temperature sensitivity) investigated in this study are of daily data and for a period of 

30  years  (2061-2090)  from  the  HadCM4.  Weather  input  data  are  maximum  and 
minimum air temperature and precipitation. CO2 concentrations of 350 and 700 ppmv 
were  suggested  and  used  in  the  models  for  the  baseline  and  future  scenarios, 

respectively (IPCC, 1995). 

2.5 Statistical analysis 

Statistical analyses were carried out using the PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, 

USA)  and  Data  Desk  (Data  Description  Inc.  New  York,  USA)  software  packages. 

Flux  data  was  checked  for  normal  distribution  and  log  transformed.  Regression 

analysis and both 1- and 2-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were applied to N2O 
flux and biomass production.  

3. Results and discussion 

3.1 Model validations and results under baseline scenario 

Temporal patterns of N2O for the observed and DayCent modelled fluxes from 
the fertilized plots were generally similar for most of the measured period. However, 

DayCent overestimated the influence of added N fertilizer by producing two types of 

N2O  peaks;  a  smaller  one  at  the  time  of  N  application  and  a  higher  one  later  in 
August,  2004  (Figure  1).  This  second  higher  peak  was  not  observed  for  the  control 

plots. Here, as both the fertilized and control plots were subjected to the same climate 

and  extensively  grazed,  it  was  clear  that  N  availability  in  the  soil  was  the  only 

difference between the two, suggesting that this later peak was due to residual effects 

of applied N fertilizer. The model suggests that applied fertilizer N is retained in the 

soil  for  long  periods  (up  to  September),  where  other  environmental  factors  like

rainfall  and  temperature  are  high  (Figure  2),  resulting  in  a  second  higher  N2O  peak 
(Figure 1). Comparisons over many years showed that the height and time of this later 

peak depends on the combined effects of higher rainfall and temperature (Figure 2). 

Rainfall increases soil moisture and stimulates denitrification by temporarily reducing 

the  oxygen  diffusion  into  the  soil  (Dobbie  and  Smith,  2001)  and  increasing  the 

solubility of organic carbon and nitrate in the soil (Bowden and Bormann 1986). High 

temperature increases both soil organic matter decomposition and microbial response 

to  other  perturbations,  such  as  fertilization  and  rainfall  (Stanford  and  Epstein  1974; 

Bramley and White, 1990; Antonopoulos, 1999; Wennman and Katterer, 2006). The 

model  also  overestimated  the  measured  soil  water  filled  pore  space  values  (WFPS; 

Figure  3).  This  overestimation  may  result  in  significant  flux  discrepancies  between 

the  measured  and  modelled  data  since  WFPS  is  a  critical  determinant  of  N2O  flux 
(Keller  and  Reiners,  1994;  Ruser  et  al.,  1998;  Dobbie  and  Smith,  2001).  This 

parameter is a key requirement for a reliable simulation of N2O (Frolking et al., 1998), 
as  increasing  WFPS  may  reduce  the  contribution  of  nitrification,  and  increase 

denitrification (Li, 2000; Li et al., 2001). 

The second simulated peak resulted in a higher cumulative N2O flux of 3.6 kg 
ha-1 compared with the measured flux of 2.6 kg ha-1, which corresponds to a relative 
deviation  of  +38%  from  the  measured  flux  (Table  2).  The  regression  between 

observed and modelled fluxes (y = 0.41x + 0.57) accounted for 32% of the variation 

in the data (RMSE = 2) (Figure 4). However, by excluding this peak, the model gave 

approximately similar cumulative N2O flux to that observed, with a deviation of only 
+1%. This is not the case for the control plots where, although this second peak was 

not observed, the model performed poorly compared to observed data with a relative 

deviation of (-57%) RMSE = 0.5 (Table 2 and Figure 1). In contrast to Del Grosso et 

al. (2008), DayCent underestimated the flux at zero N fertilizer with a cumulative flux 
of 0.5 kg ha-1 compared with a cumulative measured flux of 1 kg ha-1. The comparison 
with field data suggests that, for applications on unfertilised Irish grasslands, DayCent 

could be improved by increasing the background emissions of N2O (Del Grosso et al., 
2008). 

The  pattern  of  simulated  grass  biomass  by  the  DayCent-model  agreed  well 

with the measured results and the model underestimated observed biomass by (-23%).

The relationship between the weekly simulated above-ground grass biomass and the 

weekly  field  observed  biomass  is  illustrated  in  Figure  5.  Here,  the  regression  (y  = 

0.47x  +  0.5)  accounted  for  38%  of  the  variation  in  the  data  (RMSE  =  0.15). 

Comparable  results  using  DayCent  were  also  reported  for  wheat,  rice,  maize  and 

soybean (Stehfest et al., 2007; Del Grosso et al., 2008). Simulated soil temperature by 

DayCent  and  DNDC  compared  favourably  with  measurements  (Figure  6);  for 
DayCent r2 = 0.64 and RMSE = 0.57 whilst for DNDC r2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 0.44.  
 

Simulated emissions of N2O flux by the DNDC model showed similar patterns 
as  the  field  measured  flux  for  most  of  the  measured  period.  However,  DNDC 

predicted  a  significantly  higher  peak,  from  both  the  fertilized  and  control  plots  in 

February.  This  higher  peak  resulted  in  an  annual  cumulative  N2O  flux  of  6.04  and 
3.58 kg N2O-N ha-1, with annual differences between the measured and modelled flux 
of 3.44 and 2.58 kg N2O-N ha-1, for fertilized and control plots respectively (Table 2 
and Figure 1). Due to this peak, estimation of annual emissions was very poor with 

relative deviations of +132% (RMSE = 5.2; for fertilized plots) and +258% (RMSE = 

4;  for  the  control  plots)  from  the  measured  flux.  DNDC  also  significantly 

underestimated the observed above-ground biomass by 75% (RMSE = 0.22) (Figure 

5). The model (DNDC) is very sensitive to soil organic carbon content (SOC; Li et al., 

1996,  2001;  Beheydt  et  al.,  2007;  Abdalla  et  al.,  2009a);  a  20%  increase  in  SOC 

corresponds  to  a  58%  increase  in  N2O  flux  (Abdalla  et  al.,  2009a).  Similar  over-
estimates of the effects of initial SOC by DNDC have also been reported by Li et al. 

(1992),  Brown  et  al.  (2002)  and  Hsieh  et  al.  (2005).  DNDC  also  significantly 

overestimates observed WFPS (Figure 3), leading to a higher than observed predicted 

flux (Beheydt et al., 2007; Abdalla et al., 2009a).  

Although the Daycent model needs to be better parameterised for application 

in  Irish  grasslands,  both  cumulative  total  N2O  emission,  and  the  general  pattern  of 
emissions  agree  quite  well  with  measured  data,  and  were  better  than  equivalent 

estimates from the DNDC model, which significantly overestimated the observed flux 

and  underestimated  the  observed  biomass.  Improving  the  parameterisation  of 

DayCent  for  Irish  grasslands  will  make  the  model  a  useful  tool  for  testing  different 

mitigation  scenarios,  and  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  reporting  to  the  United 

Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  through  use  of  an

IPCC  tier  3  methodology  (IPCC,  2006).  In  this  study,  depending  on  the  results  of 

model  validations,  we  considered  that  using  DayCent  for  estimating  the  magnitude 

and seasonal trends of N2O fluxes and above ground biomass was more suitable than 
DNDC.  

 

3.2 Model results under climate change scenarios 

Because  the  DNDC  model  significantly  overestimated  observed  N2O  fluxes  and 
significantly  underestimated  observed  above  ground  biomass,  the  impacts  of  future 

climate  change  were  investigated  using  the  DayCent  model  only.  Two  climate 

scenarios from the C4I, low and high temperature sensitivity, to provide the highest 

and  lowest  impacts  of  climate  change,  were  investigated.  For  each  scenario,  the 

DayCent model was run for a period of 30 years. Simulated patterns of N2O fluxes, 
under both scenarios, were similar to that at the baseline scenario during most of the 

year  (Table  3;  Figure  7).  Here,  average  height  of  the  first  peak  at  baseline  was 

approximately similar to that of 2004 but, under climate change scenarios, DayCent 

predicted a significant increase for this peak. The reason was the higher temperature 

and  rainfall,  expected  due  to  climate  change  during  fertilizer  application,  compared 

with the baseline. The average height for the second peak at baseline was decreased 

because  time  for  this  peak  was  different  from  one  year  to  another.  However,  under 

climate change, the second peak disappeared, mainly due to the decrease in available 

N  later  in  the  season.  No  statistically  significant  difference  (p>0.05)  between  the 

annual cumulative fluxes for the three scenarios was found. Under climate change, the 

high  temperature  sensitivity  scenario  produced  slightly  higher  cumulative  nitrous 
oxide  fluxes  (4.4  kg  ha-1)  whilst  the  low  temperature  sensitivity  scenario  produced 
slightly  lower  cumulative  nitrous  oxide  fluxes  (4.1  kg  ha-1)  compared  with  the 
baseline fluxes (4.2 kg ha-1).  This is different from the significant increases in N2O 
flux predicted for a nearby  cropland field, using  DNDC, where  climate  change was 

projected  to  increase  the  flux  by  55-88%  depending  on  the  N  fertilizer  application 

rate. However, in the cropland field, most of the fluxes took place during the post crop 

harvesting period, where straw was incorporated and no crops were present (Abdalla 

et al., 2009c).  

For  both  future  scenarios,  predicted  biomass  production  was  significantly 

higher (p<0.05) than in the baseline (Figure 8). This increase was due to the overall

effect  of  increasing  rainfall,  temperature  and  CO2  concentration.  Under  baseline 
conditions, annual above-ground grass biomass (dry matter) was about 33 t ha-1 whilst 
under climate change this value was increased to 45 (+34%) and 50 (+48%) t ha-1 for 
the  low  and  high  temperature  sensitivity  scenario.  An  increase  in  grass  dry  matter 

production  in  Ireland  due  to  climate  change  was  also  predicted  by  Fitzgerald  et  al. 

(2009). Here, changes in precipitation (Rosenzweig and Tubiello, 1997; Izaurralde et 

al., 2003; Mearns et al., 2003) and temperature  (Fiscus et al., 1997)  can affect crop 

productivity.  Higher  temperatures  may  increase  plant  carboxilation  and  stimulate 

higher  photosynthesis,  respiration,  and  transpiration  rates.  Plant  growth  and 

development  would  continue  to  increase,  because  of  enhanced  metabolic  rates  at 

higher  temperatures,  combined  with  increased  carbon  availability  (Reddy  et  al., 

2000). Changing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could also have positive 

effects on plants (Mitchell et al., 1993; Curtis and Wang, 1998; Anwar et al., 2007). 

Several factors may be responsible for this effect (i) increasing CO2 has a direct effect 
on C availability by stimulating photosynthesis and reducing photorespiration (Akita 

and  Moss,  1973)  (ii)  increasing  CO2  concentrations  decrease  stomatal  conductance 
(Moss et al., 1961; Akita and Moss, 1973; Wong, 1979; Rogers et al., 1983; Morrison 

and  Gifford,  1984)  which  reduces  the  transpiration  rate  per  unit  leaf  area.  Reduced 

transpiration  will  also  increase  the  leaf  temperature  which  can  further  increase 

photosynthesis (Acock,  1990). Both an increase in photosynthesis and a  decrease in 

transpiration result in an increase in the grass water use efficiency. (iii) increases in 

CO2  decrease  the  crop  N  concentration  (Schmitt  and  Edwards,  1981;  Hocking  and 
Meyer, 1991).  

Climate feedback could have significant impacts on N2O fluxes from soil. Soil 
nitrogen  increases  due  to  increasing  mineralisation  with  changing  temperature  and 

precipitation  (Waksman  and  Gerretsen,  1931;  Kirschbaum,  1995;  Wennman  and 

Katterer,  2006;  Abdalla  et  al.,  2009c).  However,  in  this  simulation,  climate  change 

showed no significant effect on N2O flux from the soil. In our simulations, there was a 
considerably greater demand for N from enhanced grass growth under climate change 

(Figure 8). The amount of available soil N, in excess of the N requirement of the grass 

decreased, resulting in low N2O flux. Here, N2O flux has a threshold response to N, 
and the amount of N lost to atmosphere depends on the amount of N taken by the crop 

(McSwiney and Robertson, 2005; Abdalla et al., 2010). Soil mineral nitrogen and N

mineralization are the main sources of N2O production (Bouwman 1990; Granli and 
Bockman  1994;  Abdalla  et  al.,  2010).  Nitrogen  has  a  direct  influence  on  N2O 
production  by  provision  of  N  for  both  nitrification  and  denitrification  (Baggs  and 

Blum, 2004). This is in agreement with many other studies over a range of different 

soils and crop systems (McSwiney  and Robertson, 2005-arable; Abassi and Adams, 

2000;  Maddock  et  al.  2001;  Ball  et  al.,  2002  and  Maljanen  et  al.,  2002-forest  and 

grasslands).  However,  the  soil  type  under  investigation  is  a  sandy  loam  that  has 

relatively low mineralization. Soil characteristics and environmental conditions affect 

mineralisation  (Schoenau  and  Campbel,  1996),  and  the  extensive  grazing  had  no 

significant  effect  on  N2O  flux.    Compared  to  the  baseline,  a  significant  decrease 
(p<0.05) was observed for the daily soil ammonium at 15cm depth, from 35 to 14 and 
19 mg kg-1 for the high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios, respectively (Table 
3).  Therefore,  future  N2O  flux  from  this  field  will  not  be  significantly  affected  by 
climate change, unless more N fertilizer is applied.  

Considering that the grass area in Ireland is about 4 M ha (CSO, 2010), sandy 

loam  soil  make  up  >  30%  of  Irish  soil  types  and  the  nitrogen  fertilizer  application 
rates  used  by  the  farmers  at  the  time  of  this  work  were  200  kg  ha-1  N,  DayCent 
predicted large increase in above-ground grass biomass due to climate change. Under 

climate change, for the high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios, above-ground 

grass biomass could increase by approximately 68 and 48 Mt dry matter, respectively. 

However, the increase in N2O flux due to climate change under this low N input grass 
is  negligible,  suggesting  that  future  climate  change  will  favour  Irish  low  N  input 

grasslands, with more biomass but no significant change in N2O flux. 

DayCent  model  was  run  assuming  that  the  current  field  management  will 

remain  the  same  in  the  future.  However,  the  predicted  future  higher  above  ground 

biomass  production  by  DayCent  would  encourage  farmers  to  increase  grazing 

intensity. This would increase emissions of methane (CH4) and excretal N deposition 
from  grazing  animals.    Alternatively,  farmers  could  apply  less  N  fertilizer  to  the 

pasture  to  achieve  the  current  amount  of  above  ground  biomass  production  without 

making significant change on N2O or CH4 fluxes.

Although  further  improvement  is  possible,  the  DayCent  model  effectively 

estimates the N2O fluxes and biomass production from the Irish grasslands compared 
with DNDC model. DNDC significantly overestimates the measured N2O flux, with 
relative deviations of +132% (RMSE = 5.2) and 258% (RMSE = 4) for the fertilized 

and control plots. DayCent predicted N2O flux and biomass production from fertilized 
grass  with  relative  deviations  of  +38%  (RMSE  =  2)  and  (-23%)  (RMSE  =  0.15) 

compared  with  the  observed  values,  respectively.  DayCent  predicts  a  significantly 

higher peak coinciding  with higher temperature  and rainfall in August -  September, 

associated with fertiliser N still held in the soil later in the season. The model fit under 

control plots was not good with a relative deviation of (-57%) (RMSE = 0.5). Under 

climate change, grass biomass was projected to increase from the baseline value of 33 
t ha-1 to 45 (+34%) and 50 (+48%) t ha-1 for the low and high temperature sensitivity 
scenarios, respectively. Our results suggest, that due to significant grass growth and 

higher N demand by the grass, climate change is not expected to significantly affect 

N2O fluxes from this low N input pasture, unless more N is applied in the future. This 
was projected for both the high and low temperature sensitivity scenarios. Our results 

suggest that future climate change will favour the Irish, low N input grasslands with 

more biomass but with no significant change in N2O flux.
