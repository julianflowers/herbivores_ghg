Abstract
Land degradation is one of the environmental challenges in the semi-arid areas of Africa such as Ethiopia. To tackle this 
problem, exclosures have been established on degraded open grazing lands. However, there was paucity of research 
regarding their ecological merits, especially in the lowlands of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Hence, this study was con-
ducted to explore the effect of conversion of grazing lands to an exclosure on soil chemical properties and soil organic 
carbon stock (SOC stock) in Tselemti district, which was taken as testing site to represent the lowlands of Tigray. A total 
of 36 plots (18 from grazing land and 18 from exclosure), measuring 20 m × 20 m, were established along 6 transects for 
soil sampling. From each plot, 1 composite soil sample for analyses of total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (avP), 
cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), available potassium (avK), soil pH and soil organic carbon 
content (SOC) and 1 undisturbed soil sample for soil bulk density (BD) determination was collected from a depth of 
0–30 cm. Hence, a total of 72 soil samples (36 for nutrients and 36 for bulk density analysis) were analyzed in the labo-
ratory. Paired samples t test statistics at 5% level of significance using SPSS version 20 was used to compare the land 
uses. Pearson correlation test was also used to analyze the relationship among the different soil properties. The study 
showed that the conversion of open grazing land to an exclosure enhanced most of the soil properties except soil pH, 
avP and EC. The results revealed that the exclosure had significantly (p < 0.05) higher SOC (1.89 ± 0.1 and 1.29 ± 0.06) 
and SOC stock (73.61 ± 4.9 and 45.64 ± 2.57 Mg ha−1), indicating an improvement by 46.5 and 61.3% as compared to the 
grazing land. Similarly, it enhanced CEC, TN and avK level significantly (p < 0.05) by 16.8, 45.5 and 34%, respectively. It 
can be concluded that conversion of open grazing lands to exclosures is a viable option to restore degraded soils. For 
this reason, additional exclosures have to be established on previously degraded open grazing lands in the area and 
areas with similar biophysical setup.

1  Introduction

Land degradation, soil erosion and deforestation are seri-
ous problems in Ethiopia [1]. The country loses about 
1493 million tons of top soil annually [2]. On the other 
hand, FAO [3] reported an estimated deforestation rate of 
140,000–200,000 ha per annum and as a consequence, the 
forest cover declined from 15.1 million ha in 1990 to 12.2

million ha in 2010. Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, is one of the 
most environmentally degraded regions in Ethiopia, char-
acterized by erratic rainfall, overgrazing, deforestation, soil 
erosion, soil moisture stress, loss of biodiversity and soil 
fertility decline [4].

To overcome these challenges, conversion of previously 
open grazing lands to exclosures was one, among many 
environmental rehabilitation efforts that have been pro-
moted and implemented in the region in the last 30 and 
more years [5, 6]. Exclosures are areas exempted from the 
interference of humans and domestic animals with the 
goal of reducing land degradation and promoting natural 
regeneration of plants of formerly degraded grazing lands.
Studies conducted by authors [6–12] have shown the 
positive role of conversion of grazing lands to exclosures 
on restoration of soils that were previously degraded in 
the region. However, most of these studies focused in 
the mid (1500–2300 m above sea level) and highlands 
(> 2300 m above sea level) with limited focus to the low-
lands (< 1500 m above sea level) such as the study area, 
Tselemti district.

Traditionally,  the  lowlands  of Tigray  are  based  on 
extensive livestock production, with higher livestock 
population than the highlands, whereas the farmers in 
the highlands have been mainly focusing on crop pro-
duction due to land scarcity. This might bring a differ-
ence in the grazing intensity and stocking rate between 
the highland and lowland areas of the region. Accord-
ing to Amiri et al. [13], soil properties can be influenced 
by different grazing intensities and pointed out that 
heavily grazed areas (> 3 sheep ha−1) negatively influ-
enced soil properties than moderately grazed areas (> 1 
sheep ha−1). Heavy grazing can negatively influence veg-
etation by destroying and/or disrupting the soil struc-
ture, enhancing organic matter oxidation, and resulting 
in the changes of soil properties storage than light graz-
ing. Furthermore, as a result of their high livestock popu-
lation, some farmers in the lowlands of Tigray, including 
the study area, are pessimistic towards exclosure and are 
complaining about the management system and its ben-
efits. They are not sure that it is giving them more benefit 
than if it was used for livestock rearing, since they do 
not like to be deprived from environmental resources 
where it is a means of pursuing their livelihoods. Besides, 
according to Evans et al. [14], in drier and arid ecologi-
cal regions, there might be trade-offs between manag-
ing lands for rehabilitation and animal production. The 
same is true in the lowlands of Tigray. In addition, accu-
mulation of soil nutrients can vary between lowlands 
and highlands due to varying decomposition rates since 
it could affect the nutrients turnover and difference in 
plant productivity [15]. According to the authors, the 
effect of exclosure under different agro-ecologies varied 

significantly, and reported that plots located in lowland 
site contained higher amounts of soil nutrients than 
their upland counterparts at equal topographic position 
and similar treatment. These all imply that the effect of 
livestock exclusion can vary between lowland and high-
lands at similar management practices.

The  effectiveness  of  restoration  options  can  be 
affected by the differences in ecological and socio-eco-
nomic conditions, political and historical contexts and 
level of management [16]. The effect of land use conver-
sion on soil nutrients and soil organic carbon stock (SOC 
stock) is variable and it depends on soil type, land use 
history, vegetation type, climate, topography and cur-
rent land use and land cover [17, 18]. According to Meku-
ria et al. [19], the effectiveness of establishing exclosures 
to restore degraded open grazing lands varies across dif-
ferent localities due to heterogeneity of exclosure man-
agement, soil, climate and topography. Furthermore, 
studies on the effect of conversion of grazing lands to 
exclosures on soil chemical properties and soil carbon 
stock have not been consistent. For instance:

 

 

i.  Mekuria et al. [7, 20] and Yimer et al. [21] reported an 
increase in SOC stock and SOC, while the soil param-
eters were not significantly influenced by establish-
ing exclosures [22].

ii.  Tiki et al. [23] and Gebreanenia [24] reported an 
enhancement in TN level, whereas Munie [16] and 
Mekuria et al. [22] demonstrated a decrease and 
Yimer et al. [21] indicated a non-significant result.

  iii.  Bahiru [25] and Mekuria [26] indicated an increase 
in avP level, while Legesse [27], Mekuria et al. [22] 
reported a decrease. Asmamaw [28] also report a 
non- significant result.

  iv.  Tadesse  [29]  reported  an  increase  in  avK  level, 
whereas Mekuria et al. [22] and Asmamaw [28] dem-
onstrated higher in communal grazing land than in 
exclosures and a non-significant effect, respectively.
  v.  Mekuria et al. [30] pointed out an enhancement in 
CEC level, while Abiyu et al. [31] and Mekuria et al. 
[22] reported an insignificant result.

These  results  imply  a  lack  of  clear  relationship 
between grazing exclusion and soil nutrients, which 
may result from the contributions of different climate, 
soil type, landscape position, management practices 
[32], years of grazing exclusion [33], and grassland eco-
system types [34].

For this reason, generalization is difficult unless sev-
eral and representative studies are conducted across dif-
ferent locations in the region, since the agro-ecologies 
and climatic conditions varies highly in the region. This

together with the inconclusiveness of the evidence indi-
cates that there is a need to study the changes in soil 
properties and soil carbon stock following the establish-
ment of exclosures. Therefore, studies which investigate 
the role of conversion of previously degraded grazing 
lands  to  exclosures  under  different  agro-ecologies, 
socio-economic conditions, soil types and level of man-
agement are crucial. Moreover, quantifying the effect 
of establishing exclosures for ecological restoration is 
critical to provide important source of information for 
policy makers and planners to make informed decisions 
on the future fates of exclosures and for understand-
ing the appropriate management and conservation of 
degraded communal grazing lands, designing ways of 
improving soil properties and soil carbon stock through 
exclosure establishment and create better awareness to 
the community to enhance their effort of land rehabili-
tation. Hence, this study was conducted to explore the 
effect of conversion of previously degraded communal 
grazing land into an exclosure on soil chemical proper-
ties and SOC stock in Tselemti district, Northern Ethiopia, 
representing the lowlands of Tigray region.

Based on the stated goals of restoration by exclosures, 
we hypothesize that exclosures can be effective in restor-
ing degraded soil chemical properties and soil organic 
stock. Finally, the study will answer the research ques-
tion ‘‘do exclosures established in lowland areas of Tigray 

region, Northern Ethiopia, have a potential to improve soil 
chemical properties and SOC stock?’’.

2   Materials and methods

2.1   Study area

The study was conducted at Mai-Saba exclosure and its 
adjacent grazing land, Sekota-Mariam Kebelle (the small-
est political administration units in Ethiopia) in Tselemti 
district, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia (Fig. 1), which is 380 km 
far from Mekelle, capital city of Tigray region, towards 
North West. The district is located at 13° 05′ latitude and 
38° 18′ longitude at an altitude of 1350 m above sea level 
(m a.s.l) [35]. Areas characterized at an elevation ranging 
from 500 to 1500 m a.s.l. are classified as lowland or locally 
called ‘Kolla’ [36]. The exclosure was protected (closed) 
against any disturbance from humans and livestock since 
1999.

Five years (2012–2016) temperature data show that 
the temperature in the study area varies from 15.6 °C in 
January to 38.6 °C in April. The dry season occurs between 
November  and  April,  while  the  rainy  season  occurs 
between June and September (Fig. 2). The study sites are 
characterized by rugged topography where the land is 
undulating with mountainous terrain and flat plains.

A range of soil types are found in the district, but the domi-
nant soil type on the escarpment slopes where this study was 
carried out are Cambisols [37]. These soils are soils which are at 
the beginnings of horizon differentiation in the subsoil evident 
from changes in structure and color, characterized by slight or 
moderate weathering of parent material and brownish discolor-
ation as well [38]. The soil texture of these soils is loamy to clayey 
and the texture of the subsurface horizons are sandy loam or 
finer. Ziziphus spina- christi, Balanites aegyptiaca, Stereospermum 
kunthianum and Acacia abyssinica are the most common woody 
vegetation species in the exclosure and Anogeisus leiocarpus 
was the most dominant species in the grazing land. Of these 
species, Ziziphus spina-christi, Balanites aegyptiaca and Acacia 
abyssinica are nitrogen fixers. The community mainly depends 
on mixed agriculture (both crop and animal husbandry) for live-
lihood. The dominant crops grown are Sorghum bicolour L., Zea 
mays L. and Eleusine coracana L. [35] and the major livestock are 
donkeys, cattle, chicken and goats.

2.2   Description and land management history 

of both the land uses

Exclosures in the study area refer to areas exempted from the 
interference of humans and domestic animals with the goal 
of environmental rehabilitation, which are implemented 
on community land, most frequently on very steep and 
degraded slopes using community regulation by appointing 
guards. The exclosures are totally protected from any live-
stock and human activities until the community and local 
administration agree on its full rehabilitation. When all par-
ties agree that the land is rehabilitated, the community uses 
the accessible part of the exclosures to harvest dry herbs 
during the dry season for livestock feed using cut and carry 
system. Harvesting is operated when herbs are dry and grass 
harvesting (using a cut and carry system) is allowed and is 
conducted once a year, starting 4–5 years after exclosure 
establishment. However, tree cutting is also not allowed. 
The area in this study was identified and prioritized for 
establishing exclosures as a joint initiative of governmental 

institutions mainly of development agents of office of agri-
culture and rural development and local communities. Then, 
final decisions were taken at a general meeting of the com-
munity so that to make the protection effective. Bylaws were 
devised through participatory process. For instance, there is 
a penalty when agreed rules are broken, e.g., when people 
illegally graze livestock or cut trees at night or when guards 
were not around. The current management-related activities 
relate to only guarding and harvesting grass annually. The 
long-term plans of establishing exclosures are for environ-
mental rehabilitation and economic benefit. Once the exclo-
sures are established, they will not be re-used for grazing.

Open grazing land represents the communal lands that 
are not privately owned, yet belonging to the communities 
whose members have equal access rights to the communal 
resources. On these lands, unlimited access for free graz-
ing is practiced, while illegal tree cutting is not allowed. 
According to Mekuria et al. [7], the stocking rate of com-
munal grazing lands is 1.4 livestock ha−1 year−1. The area of 
the exclosure and the grazing land in this study is 20.3 and 
28.8 ha, respectively. Accordingly, a total of 40.3 livestock 
could graze throughout the year. The communal grazing 
land was observed to be under heavy grazing pressure 
and severe land degradation. Rill and sheet erosion in the 
grazing land were observed to be relatively more common 
compared to the exclosure. In addition, it was character-
ized by low vegetation cover, sediment deposits and higher 
proportions of bare soil than the exclosure.

The  exclosure  in  this  study  was  protected  (closed) 
against any disturbance from humans and livestock since 
1999. Before establishment, the exclosure and the adjacent 
grazing land had similar conditions, because the exclo-
sure was established on parts of the degraded communal 
grazing land that was used for livestock grazing which 
means the same site was divided into both exclosure and 
open grazing land and established in steep, eroded, and 
degraded areas that have been used for grazing in the 
past. Hence, it is assumed that the exclosure and the graz-
ing lands were homogenous before the establishment of 
the exclosure. The distance between the exclosure and the 
adjacent grazing land was in the range of 50–100 m. The 
elevation and slope gradient of the sampling plots in both 
the land uses range between 1196–1405 m and 7–44%, 
respectively, with similar aspect (towards west) (Table 1). 
The abundant plant species were found to be naturally 
regenerated, while no planted seedlings were observed in 
both the land uses. Besides, no other management prac-
tices such as physical structures were observed.

knowledge  of  study  sites,  was  done. The  experts  and 
administrators were briefed on the study’s objective to 
get permission since humans interference is not allowed 
in the closed area. Hence, they permit us to conduct the 
study in both the land uses. Visual field observations and 
a reconnaissance survey were conducted in the second 
week of November 2016 to collect the baseline informa-
tion and determine the number of transect lines and plots 
to be laid.

Space for time substitution approach [39] was used to 
detect changes in soil chemical properties and SOC stock 
after conversion of grazing land to exclosure. According 
to Pickett [40], the approach has been a very widely used 
to the study of long-term phenomena in ecology and it 
has been used most often and most successfully, in sys-
tems acknowledged to have strong successional dynam-
ics and has been long recognized as having potential for 
understanding community temporal dynamics. Accord-
ing to the author, it has been used to assess the impact of 
human-induced changes in the environment where pre-
impact records are sparse or nonexistent. Furthermore, 
this chronological method is widely adopted in applied 
ecosystem  research  [41],  considered  a “retrospective” 
research method, because it compares existing conditions 
with original conditions and treatments and it is an effec-
tive way of studying changes over time since disturbance 
or land use change in a region [39, 42, 43]. The implicit 
assumption of this approach is that exclosures and paired 
adjacent grazing lands had similar initial conditions such 
that the changes in soil properties after a time is a conse-
quence of conversion process from open grazing lands to 
exclosures [20] and not by inherent site variability.

A systematic random sampling technique was used to 
collect soil samples. Three line transects parallel to each 
other and across the slope were laid in the exclosure and 
open grazing lands systematically at 150 meters interval. 
That is, we delineated three landscape positions (upper 
slope, mid-slope and foot slope) which were parallel to 
each other and to the topography of the landscape (Fig. 3). 

The upper slope position is the upper most position of 
each land use and it receives little or no overland flow but 
may contribute runoff to down slope areas. The middle 
slope position receives overland flow from the upper slope 
and contributes runoff to the foot slope. The foot slope 
represents the lowest part of each study site and receives 
overland flow from both mid and upper slopes. Along each 
transect line, six sample plots measuring 20 m × 20 m [44] 
were laid down at 100 meters intervals from each other. 
The first plot was laid down randomly in all of the tran-
sects and the other plots systematically at equal interval in 
each of the transects. To avoid the effect of disturbances, 
the first and the last line transects and plots were laid at 
a distance of at least 30 m from the edges from all sides 
in both of the land uses. From each plot, soil samples and 
all related information were collected from December to 
January 2016.

Thus, a total of 36 plots (18 plots from each land use 

type) were used to collect soil samples.

2.4   Soil sampling

In each of the 36 plots, five soil pits, from four corners 
and at the center, with an area of 1 m × 0.6 m, following 
the recommendation by Yimer et al. [21] were dug in an 
‘X’ design in both the land uses. From each pit, soil sam-
ples from a depth of 0–30 cm [45] were collected and 
thoroughly mixed in a large bucket to form one com-
posite soil sample per plot for TN, SOC, avK, avP, EC, CEC 
and soil pH analysis. According to Badgery et al. [46], 
effect of land use management changes are more likely 
to occur in the upper 0–30 cm profile. In one of the five 
pits, an undisturbed soil samples using core sampler of 
height 5 cm and diameter of 5 cm (5 cm × 5 cm) were 
also collected from each plot for BD determination. 
Hence, a total of 72 soil samples (36 for nutrients and 
36 for BD analysis), from both land uses, were collected 
and submitted to Mekelle Soil Research Center labora-
tory, Tigray region. The collected composite soil samples

To determine the SOC stock, the dried, 2 mm sieved soil 
was weighed and the volume of coarse fragments was 
recorded for coarse fragments correction. Then, it was 
calculated using the following formula:

SOC stock = [WBC × BD × D × (1 −

metric content of the coarse fragments (> 2 mm material) 
was calculated from a density of rock fragments value of 
2.65 g cm−3 [55].

at 5% level of significance using SPSS version 20 to com-
pare the land uses. The mean of the analyzed soil proper-
ties of the 18 plots from the exclosure were compared to 
the mean of the 18 plots in grazing land. Pearson correla-
tion test was also used to analyze the relationship among 
the different soil properties.

3   Results and discussions

Significantly (p < 0.001) higher SOC was measured in the 
exclosure (1.89 ± 0.1 g/100 g) as compared to the graz-
ing land (1.29 ± 0.06 g/100 g) (Table 3). Likewise, con-
version of the grazing land to exclosure had brought 
significant  (p < 0.001)  variation  in  SOC  stock.  It  has 
improved from 45.64 ± 2.57 Mg ha−1 in the grazing land 
to 73.61 ± 4.94 Mg ha−1 in the exclosure (Fig. 4), showing an 
increase by 61.3% and indicates the land use conversion 
has added an average of 1.65 Mg ha−1 of SOC stock per 
annum. The reasons for lower SOC and SOC stock in the 
grazing land might be due to loss of soil structure by live-
stock free grazing and removal of vegetation by both live-
stock and human, which might have exposed soil materials 
to erosion [56], whereas higher amount of organic carbon 
in the exclosure might be due to higher leaf litter, reduced 
soil erosion as a result of higher vegetation cover as well 
as low agitation in the soils of the exclosure. This corre-
sponds with the findings of Gebremariam and Kebede [57] 
in Tahtay Adiabo district, Northern Ethiopia, who reported 
an enhancement of SOC stock by 25%; Gebreanenia [24] 
an increase of SOC by 80% in Alamata district, Southern 
Tigray. Authors [7, 8, 11, 20] also reported from different 
districts of Tigray region that conversion of grazing lands 
to exclosures improved SOC stock and SOC significantly. 
Similarly, Yimer et al. [21] from Dodota sire district, Ethio-
pia, pointed out that an exclosure enhanced SOC by 13.5% 
compared to grazing land.

The  conversion  of  open  grazing  land  to  an  exclo-

converted the low level of nitrogen to optimum level. 
According to ATA [58], TN is low if is 0.1–0.15% and opti-
mum if it is 0.15–3.0%. This could be due to higher soil 
organic matter content and the presence of nitrogen fix-
ing plants in the exclosure compared to the grazing land. 
Pearson correlation matrix (Table 4) also showed that 
TN was positively and significantly associated with SOC 
(r = 0.746, p < 0.01). According to Niknahad et al. [59], soil 
organic matter is the most important source of TN; hence, 
changes in soil TN are likely related to organic matter 
change in rangelands. This confirms the finding of Gebre-
anenia [24], who reported an enhancement by more than 
twofold in Southern Tigray and Mureithi et al. [60] by 83%

in semi-arid range land of Kenya. Other prior studies [6, 
23], also indicated a positive impact of exclosures on soil 
nitrogen content. Nonetheless, it contradicts a report by 
Munie [16], from South Western Ethiopia, who pointed out 
that TN in the soil decreased by 50% after conversion of 
grazing land into exclosure and Yong-Zhong et al. [61] and 
Yimer et al. [21], who reported that exclosures and graz-
ing lands were not significantly different in TN % level. The 
difference from this study could be due to difference in 
rate of decomposition of soil organic matter as a result of 
difference in temperature, rainfall and soil pH. For instance, 
Munie ([16] conducted the study in Illubabor zone, South 
Western Ethiopia, at an elevation of 1800 m.a.s.l, with a 
minimum and maximum annual temperature of 12.7 and 
25.6 °C which is lower than in this study. Besides, the study 
area was more acidic (4.3–6.7) than in this study. Yimer 
et al. [21], from Dodota Sire, Arsi zone (with an elevation 
of 1635–1795 m.a.s.sl and annual rainfall of 500–700 mm), 
also reported a non-significant difference between the 
two land uses. According to Pineiro et al. [62], a difference 
in temperature could bring a difference in rate of decom-
position of soil organic matter and in turn the level of TN. 
Soil acidity can also adversely affect the nitrogen level as 
well. A study conducted in Mongolia, Northern China, has 
also shown that the land use conversion didn’t affect the 
TN level significantly [61]. The study area, Mongolia, has 
different and lowest mean temperature (6.5 °C) and rainfall 
(366 mm) than the area in this study.

The result demonstrated that conversion of open graz-
ing lands to an exclosure had no significant ((p > 0.05) 
effect on the level of avP. However, the mean value was 
slightly higher in the exclosure than in the open grazing 
land. The numerical, but not statistical difference in phos-
phorus level between the land uses could be due to addi-
tion of animal manure to the grazing land which in turn 
could slightly increase the avP level since interference of 
animals is allowed in the grazing land. According to Munie 
[16], faeces of animals could enhance the level of soil 

nutrients in grazing lands. Generally, the avP in the study 
area is classified as acutely deficient, indicating that there 
is high deficiency of avP in the study area. According to 
ATA [58], majority of Tigray region soils, including the study 
district, were categorized under ‘very low’ (0–15 mg g−1) 
status. The present study is in agreement with the findings 
of Asmamaw [28]; Lu et al. [63] and Umer and Sinore [64], 
who did not report a significant difference between the 
land uses in their avP level. In contrast to these findings, 
Bahiru [25] and Mekuria [26] reported that the conversion 
of open grazing lands into exclosures enhanced the level 
of avP and Legesse [27] found a higher value of avP in 
communal grazing land compared with 22 years old exclo-
sure. In addition, Ajorlo et al. [65], from Malaysia reported 
significantly higher AvP in grazed areas than exclosures. 
According to Prasad and Power [66], the presence of phos-
phorus content depends upon a number of factors such 
as vegetation type, soil texture, climate and drainage. This 
might bring a difference between the result in this study 
and other various prior studies.

Available potassium in the exclosure ranged from 59.6 
to 67.2 mg kg−1, with a mean value of 63.27 ± 0.54 mg kg−1, 
while it ranges from 43.4 to 50.5, with a mean value of 
47.21 ± 0.46 mg kg−1) in the grazing land and it was signifi-
cantly (p < 0.001) higher in the exclosure than the grazing 
land (Table 3). The lower available potassium content of 
the grazing land could be due to higher soil leaching rates. 
According to Hosseinzadeh et al. [67], grazing can cause 
higher soil leaching rates and in turn lower potassium con-
tent since it is cashed more easily than other nutrients. 
Moraes and Dynia [68] considered K as the most easily 
leached cation due to its displacement to the soil solu-
tion and to its percolation. Legesse [27], also pointed out 
that because of its high mobility in the soil, avK is most 
susceptible to leaching losses, which might be the reason 
for the decline of this vital nutrient in free grazing land. 
The finding in this study corroborates with prior studies 
at different districts in Ethiopia [11, 27, 29].

Research Article

The process of conversion of open grazing land to exclo-
sure has improved the CEC level significantly (p < 0.05). The 
mean value has increased from 30.41 ± 1.39 cmol (+)/kg) in 
the grazing land to 35.53 ± 1.06 cmol (+)/kg) in the exclo-
sure (Table 3), indicating an enhancement of 16.8%. The 
difference in CEC level between the land use types may be 
attributed to the higher soil organic matter content in the 
exclosure. According to Moges et al. [69], the level of CEC 
of soils depends mainly on the amount of soil organic mat-
ter available in the soil. This is also supported by correla-
tion matrix (Table 4) that showed  positive and significant 
association of CEC with SOC (r = 0.837, p < 0.01), reflecting 
that the increase in soil organic matter could increase the 
CEC level. The present study supports the findings of dif-
ferent authors [16, 30, 64], who reported higher CEC in 
exclosures of different ages than their adjacent open graz-
ing areas. However, it is not consistent with a finding by 
Abiyu et al. [31] and Oduor et al. [70] at South Wello Zone, 
Ethiopia and Northwestern Kenya, respectively, who found 
that exclosures and grazing lands didn’t vary significantly 
in their CEC level and Mekuria et al. [22], who pointed out 
that grazing lands showed higher CEC level than 7 year old 
exclosure. Such variation in the changes in soil CEC level 
across different study sites might be due to difference in 
the rainfall and temperature which determines the rate of 
decomposition of soil organic matter [62].

Though  not  significant  (p > 0.05),  the  grazing  land 
had slightly higher EC level (0.16 ± 0.01 ds m−1) than the 
exclosure (0.14 ± 0.01 ds m−1) (Table 3). The insignificant 
higher soil salinity in the grazing land could be due to the 
absence of foliage vegetation cover which leads to rela-
tively higher evaporation and poor infiltration. This result 
comes to an agreement with a finding by Gebreanenia 
[24], who indicated that conversion of open grazing land 
to an exclosure decreased the EC level by 10%, but the 
difference was not statistically significant. Similar results 
were also reported from previous studies [29, 64]. How-
ever, the present finding was not consistent with a find-
ing by Munie [16], who reported that EC was significantly 
higher in exclosure than grazing land.

The conversion of the land uses didn’t bring significant 
(p > 0.05) change in soil pH level (Table 3), though the graz-
ing land had numerically higher soil pH than exclosure. 
The numerically but not statistically lower soil pH in the 
exclosure could be due to more root biomass and active 
microorganism metabolism in the rhizosphere, which 
helps to reduce pH level as a result of extensive secretion 
of organic acids from roots and amount of  CO2 released 
from roots and microorganisms [61, 71, 72]. This result is 
in-line with the result found by Mureithi et al. [60], who 
reported that conversion of grazing lands into exclosures 
didn’t affect soil pH significantly, but was not consist-
ent with a study by Mekuria et al. [22], who found that 

exclosures of age 4–7 years had significantly higher soil 
pH than communal grazing lands and 2-year old exclosure. 
Umer and Sinore [64] also reported a significantly higher 
soil pH in an exclosure than the grazing land in southern 
Ethiopia after six years of exclusion.

4   Conclusions

The  conversion  of  open  grazing  land  to  an  exclosure 
improved most of the soil properties except soil pH, EC 
and avP. The land use conversion enhanced SOC stock and 
soil properties like SOC, TN, av. K and CEC significantly. 
From the result, it can be concluded that establishment 
of exclosures on degraded communal grazing lands is a 
viable option to enhance degraded soils. As the present 
study focused only on soil chemical properties and soil 
organic carbon stock, further studies on fauna and micro-
organisms, erosion control, hydrology, downstream agri-
cultural production and socio-economic factors analysis 
that determine the sustainability of the land use systems 
need to be undertaken.
