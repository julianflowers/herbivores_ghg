Abstract: Despite the positive impact of no-tillage (NT) on soil organic carbon (SOC), its potential
to reduce soil CO2 emission still needs enhancing for climate change mitigation. Combining NT
with controlled-grazing of crop residues is known to increase nutrient cycling; however, the impacts
on soil CO2 efﬂuxes require further exploration. This study compared soil CO2 efﬂuxes and SOC
stocks from conventional tillage with free grazing (CTFG), NT with free grazing (NTFG), NT without
grazing (NTNG), NT without crop residues (NTNR) and NT with controlled-grazing (NTCG), in
South Africa. Soil CO2 efﬂuxes were measured 1512 times over two years using LI-COR 6400XT,
once to thrice a month. Baseline SOCs data were compared against values obtained at the end of
the trial. Overall, NTCG decreased soil CO2 ﬂuxes by 55 and 29% compared to CTFG and NTNR,
respectively. NTCG increased SOCs by 3.5-fold compared to NTFG, the other treatments resulted
in SOC depletion. The increase in SOCs under NTCG was attributed to high C input and also
low soil temperature, which reduce the SOC mineralization rate. Combining NT with postharvest
controlled-grazing showed high potential to increase SOCs, which would help to mitigate climate
change. However, it was associated with topsoil compaction. Therefore, long-term assessment under
different environmental, crop, and soil conditions is still required.

1. Introduction

Increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentrations in the atmosphere have con-
tributed to the dramatic increase in global surface temperature (by 0.8–1.5 ◦C) since the late
nineteenth century [1]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major GHGs in the atmosphere.
The atmospheric CO2 accumulated to 545 ± 55 Pg C (1 Pg = 1015 g = 1 billion tonnes)
over the years from 1870 to 2014 [2]. This quantity is in the same order of magnitude
as the amount of carbon (C) in the biosphere (620 Pg C) and the atmosphere (720 Pg C).
Two thirds of the atmospheric CO2 originated from the combustion of fossil fuels [2]. The
rest is linked to agricultural malpractices such as deforestation, improper land use and
land mismanagement, which lead to low soil C input from litter and high soil C losses,
i.e., mineralization and soil erosion [3–5].

There is strong interest in reducing, or at least stabilizing, GHG emissions to the
atmosphere to combat global warming, which was the main agenda of the December 2015

Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris, France. At the COP21, an ambitious international
program, “4 per 1000 initiative: Soil for Food Security and Climate” was launched. The
initiative aimed to increase global soil organic C (SOC) by 0.4% per year in the top 40 cm
layer to compensate for global GHGs emissions induced anthropogenically (http://4p1000.
org). To achieve a 0.4% increase per year, a 30 to 40% increase in C inputs to soil is required
for 30 years, i.e., in SOC-unsaturated croplands soil, France [6]. However, increasing
SOC stocks need an optimum balance between C inputs, i.e., C translocation by plants,
residues, manure and C outputs, i.e., harvests, SOC mineralization and leaching, which is
challenging and requires a drastic change in the management practices [7–9].

Soil management practices such as no-tillage (NT), mulching with crop residues,
fertilizer application and crop rotations have shown potential to sequester organic C into
soils over the long term [10–12]. While there is a consensus on NT beneﬁts for soil C
sequestration [13–15], some studies have reported limited beneﬁts [16–18], others reported
no effect [19,20] or even a negative effect [21,22]. As a result of the existing discrepancies,
several recent studies [14,23] sought to promote both conservation and climate-smart
agriculture as a comprehensive management practice that delivers adaptation, mitigation
and productivity instead of NT only [24,25]. For example, combining NT, residue retention
and crop rotation to increase soil inﬁltration rate, reduce soil erosion and maintain a
favorable environment for soil macrofauna for residue incorporation [26,27]. For example,
in a global meta-analysis, [13] reported 23% reduction in soil CO2 efﬂuxes under NT with
crop residue mulching than NT without crop residue retention. Additionally, organic
manure, i.e., manure and liquid fertilizer, are commonly used to increase NT potential
for C sequestration [23,28,29]. However, smallholder farmers usually hesitate to adopt
conservation agriculture that requires complete crop residues retention because of the need
for the residue as livestock feed [30].

Integrating postharvest crop residues free grazing with NT provides low-cost fod-
der for livestock, diversifying agricultural systems, and organic inputs by animal excreta
enhancing soil C sequestration. However, postharvest grazing is found to contribute posi-
tively to SOC, but also increases topsoil (0–0.05 m depth) compaction [31]. Time-controlled
postharvest grazing, i.e., 14 days grazing followed by 101 days resting time, increased SOC
and ground litter accumulation with no effect on soil compaction in southeast Queensland
Australia [32]. Such a result was explained by the long resting period following the high
stocking rate grazing for a few days, allowing the soil to recover from hoof damage and
enabling litter incorporation and SOC accumulation. Integrating postharvest controlled
grazing with NT to increase C input to soils has intensively been studied. Yet, little has been
carried out in terms of investigating the C outputs as soil CO2 emissions, with particular fo-
cus on the underlying mechanisms by which this combination can alter soil C sequestration
need a further appraisal. Hence, a high-density stocking rate for short-duration previously
showed a great potential to rehabilitate degraded grassland by replenishing SOC by 7.4%
year−1 and increasing aboveground grass biomass by a maximum of 900% in the study
area [33]. The current study hypothesized that controlled crop residue grazing (i.e., high
stocking rate for few days per year) maximizes C input into the NT soil (i.e., through
animal excreta and ground litter) and minimizing the C outputs by mineralization of native
SOC (and erosion) leading to greater net C accumulation than the conventional residue
managements. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to evaluate soil CO2 efﬂuxes
and topsoil SOCs under NT associated with different crop residue management practices
in smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Site

The study site was located in Potshini community (long: 29◦21(cid:48); lat: −28◦81(cid:48), 1305 m a.s.l.),
10 km south of Bergville town, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Based on the Köppen classiﬁ-
cation system, the climate of the area was sub-tropical humid characterized by hot and wet
seasons, representing summers and autumns (October to April), and cold and dry seasons,

Agronomy 2021, 11, 1421

3 of 15

representing winters and springs (May to September). The mean annual temperature
and precipitation of the area were 13 ◦C and 684 mm, respectively [34]. The upslope area
of Potshini, characterized by shallow soils, was used for livestock grazing, whereas the
downslope area, with deep soils (>1.5 m) on 0–10% slopes, was used for rain-fed crop
production, mainly maize production [35].

Maize (Zea mays) was the main crop planted in early January every year on lands
tilled with plows. Planting, weeding and harvesting were carried out manually. Little to
no fertilizer was applied due to a lack of required funds to purchase the fertilizers. The
parent materials were mainly sandstone and mudstone, while the soils were classiﬁed as
acidic Acrisols [36]. The soil is deep (>1.2 m), acidic (pH 4.5–5.2), has a low cation exchange
capacity (2–4 cmol+ kg−1), and SOC content of 9–12 g C kg−1 [37]. The A-horizon was
approximately 0.35 m deep, with a sandy-loam texture (55–68% sand and 17–19% clay
content, respectively) and ﬁne granular structure [35,37]. Arable land is a limited resource
in the area due to a combination of high population and demand for land, and shallow soils
and steep slopes (e.g., the hillslopes had gradients exceeding 50%). The farmland where
the experiment is conducted was cultivated and managed traditionally, i.e., conventional
ox-drawn plow-tilled, rain-fed monoculture maize production and allowing postharvest
free grazing of the crop residues, for a long time before the trial was set up in 2011.

2.2. Experimental Design and Treatments

The experiment was performed on an area of 450 m2 given by the community, with
homogeneous soil which was utilized before by Mchunu et al. [37] and Chaplot et al. [26]
to study the impact of NT on soil and C losses by water erosion. This area was divided into
ﬁve plots of 90-m2 size each and each plot was divided into three subplots (30-m2 each).
Each plot was subjected to speciﬁc tillage and crop residue management; namely (i) NTCG;
no-tillage with controlled grazing, (ii) NTFG; no-tillage with free grazing, (iii) NTNG;
no-tillage with no grazing (approx. 100% crop residue mulching), (iv) NTNR; no-tillage
without crop residues mulching, and (v) CTFG; conventional tillage with free grazing were
applied. No-tillage (NT) practice was a manual operation performed using a wooden
wedge to open narrow slots of sufﬁcient width and depth (approx. 0.05 m × 0.05 m) to
guarantee proper maize seed cover with minimum soil disturbance. Controlled grazing
at a stocking rate equivalent to 1200 heads of cattle per hectare was practiced for three
consecutive days per year in NTCG. The NTFG plot was open to free livestock grazing
after grain harvest every year. The other NT plots were fenced to control grazing. There
was no grazing in NTNG (i.e., approximately 100% crop residue retention). Crop residues
were removed from NTNR (0% crop residue retention). CTFG was the traditional practice
where soil was tilled using an ox-drawn plow, and cattle were allowed to graze the crop
residues freely immediately after harvesting, mimicking the commonly used practice in
the area. In all cases, the plant spacing adopted approximated 1.0 m between rows and
0.3 m within the rows. Three 1-m2 quadrants adopted in each subplot (nine per treatment)
served as pseudoreplication for measurements of soil CO2 emissions, soil properties and
aboveground biomass production.

2.3. Soil CO2 Efﬂux Measurement

Soil CO2 efﬂuxes were measured from January 2013 to May 2015, once a month in
the dry season and twice a month in the wet season, except for the tilling month, where
the CO2 efﬂuxes were measured three to four times per month. Three polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) collars with 0.05 m height and 0.12 m diameter were inserted 0.03 m into the soil in
each 1-m2 quadrant (nine per treatment). The collars were inserted between the plant rows
during the ﬁrst week of January 2013. The collars were kept in their positions during the
trial period and were only moved in CTFG to allow tillage and in NTCG to avoid damage
during high-density livestock stocking in the controlled grazing system. Any plants in the
collars were picked by hand. The LI-COR 6400XT gas exchange system (LI-COR, Lincoln,
NE, USA) attached with a LI-COR 6400-09 soil respiration chamber was used to measure

Agronomy 2021, 11, 1421

4 of 15

CO2 efﬂuxes from the soil. The chamber covered a soil surface area of 71.6 cm2 and had
an internal volume of 991 cm3. It was inserted into the PVC collars during soil CO2 efﬂux
measurements. First measurements were carried out one week after inserting the collars
into soils to eliminate the effects of soil disturbance [38]. Measurements were carried out
between 10.00 and 13.00 h to limit the effects of diurnal temperature variations [39,40].

2.4. Soil Temperature and Water Content

Soil temperature was measured using a thermocouple connected to the LI-COR cham-
ber (LI-COR 6400-09). The thermocouple was 0.15 m long; however, it was inserted only
0.05 m into the soil close to CO2 measurement points within the 1-m2 quadrants to measure
topsoil temperature. The soil temperature was measured at the same time as the CO2 mea-
surements. Nine soil temperature measurements were also made per treatment, which was
similar to soil CO2 measurements. Soil water content measurements were also performed
close to the collars using a portable Hydrosense soil moisture meter (Campbell Scientiﬁc,
Inc., Logan, UT, USA). Due to shipping delays and malfunctioning of the probe, soil water
content data collection only covered the period from December 2014 to April 2015. The
Hydrosense was calibrated by noting the meter responses on saturated soils in the study
area. Precipitation and air temperature data were obtained from a Duncan weather station
located at the same altitude, about 500 m from the trial site.

2.5. Soil Sampling and Analysis

Soil samples were collected using a metallic cylinder with a size of 0.075 m diameter
and 0.05 m height. The soil samples were collected from the topsoil (0–0.05 m) layer in all
treatments for evaluation of SOC content (SOCc) and soil N content (Nc). The results were
compared against soil analysis results from 2012 when the experiment began. Three soil
sampling positions from around the PVC collars were used per subplot in each treatment.
The soil samples were air-dried for 48 h, sieved through 2 mm sieves and ground for
chemical analysis. Total C and N were measured using LECO CNS-2000 Dumas dry matter
combustion analyzer (LECO Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). The total soil C was considered
equivalent to SOC content when no more reaction with HCl was obtained. SOC and N
stocks (SOCs and Ns) were calculated following [41]:

SOCs or Ns = SOCc or Nc × ρb × t (1 − (pf /100))

(1)
where SOCs or Ns was the soil organic C stock (kg C m−2) or nitrogen stocks (kg N m−2);
SOCc or Nc are the soil organic C content or nitrogen content in ≤2 mm soil material (g
C kg−1 soil); ρb was the bulk density of the soil (kg m−3); t the thickness of the soil layer
(m); pf the proportion (%) of fragments >2 mm; and b a constant equal to 0.001.

Soil bulk density (ρb) was determined from undisturbed soil samples collected using
the metallic cylinders (0.075 m diameter and 0.05 m height). The samples were also collected
from around the PVC collars resulting in nine undisturbed soil samples per treatment. The
soils were stored and transported in airtight plastic bags. The samples were dried in an
oven until a constant weight was attained. The soil ρb was determined using the ratio of
water content corrected mass to volume of the soil following [42]:
ρb = (odw − r f − cw)/(cv − (r f /dr))

(2)
where ρb was the bulk density of <2 mm soil material (g cm−3); odw the oven-dry weight
(g); rf the weight of rock fragments (g); cw the empty core weight (g); cv the core volume
(cm−3); and dr the density of the rocks fragments (g cm−3).

2.6. Penetration Resistance

Penetration resistance, a proxy for soil compaction of the topsoil (0–0.05 m) layer, was
measured using a cone penetrometer [43]. Fifteen random measurements were taken in
each demarcated 1-m2 subplot, resulting in 45 points for each treatment. The penetration

Agronomy 2021, 11, 1421

5 of 15

resistance was measure in 2014 and 2015 at the beginning of the seasons before any grazing
and/or tillage occurred.

2.7. Dry Maize Biomass

Maize plants (grain and vegetative biomass) were entirely harvested from the de-
marcated 1-m2 quadrats (approx. 8 plants per m2) in each subplot. The fresh harvest
was weighed in the ﬁeld, and subsamples representing the whole plants were taken to
the laboratory and dried in an oven at 60 ◦C until constant weight was achieved. The
moisture content of the subsamples was used in the calculations of total aboveground dry
biomass for each treatment. All the plant materials, except for NTNR, were returned to the
respective plots to ensure the best application of the treatments.

2.8. Data Analysis

While the Pseudoreplication design is not ideal for most ecological trials, using such
an approach is justiﬁed considering the values of this experiment, i.e., natural landscape
for local community demonstration, in a region scarcely studied in this sense so far, and
potential statistical solutions [44,45]. Hence, restricted maximum likelihood mixed (RMEL)
was used in the current study, where the treatments were considered ﬁxed effects while the
subplots (pseudo-replicates) were the random effects. Therefore, a repeated- analysis of
variance (repeated-ANOVA) was used to test the effects of treatments, time of sampling
on the soil CO2 ﬂux, soil temperature and soil water content. The effect of seasons and
treatments on soil CO2 efﬂuxes were analyzed using RMEL repeated-measures because the
measurements were repeated at the exact locations over time. Likewise, soil temperature
and soil water content were analyzed using RMEL repeated analysis. This analysis used
the time series covariance in the repeated analysis model, where the correlation decreased
with time.

Soil properties data (SOCs, SOCc, Nc, Ns, ρb and penetration resistance), average CO2
ﬂux (overall average, wet, and dry seasons and aboveground biomass production were
analyzed using a linear mixed model, where the treatments were considered as ﬁxed effects
and the sub-plot as the random effects. The treatment means of all the parameters were
compared using Tukey test for multiple comparisons, at p < 0.05, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
The means variation was documented using standard error. The principal component
analysis was used to evaluate the multiple relationships between soil CO2 efﬂux and the
factors of control. All the statistical analysis were conducted using Genstat (version 14,
VSN International, Hemel Hempstead, UK, 2011), and the ﬁgures were generated using
Sigma Plot software (version 10.0, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

3. Results
3.1. Precipitation and Air Temperature

The total annual precipitation was 718 and 562 mm in 2013 and 2014, respectively, with
90% of the rainfall in each year occurring in the hot and wet period (i.e., from November
to April) (Figure 1A). The average annual air temperature was 17 and 18 ◦C in 2013 and
2014, respectively. The highest daily average air temperature of 38 ◦C was recorded in
September 2014 and the lowest of 13 ◦C in June in both 2013 and 2014. The daily average
air temperature of 33 ◦C for July–September 2014 was much higher than the same period
in 2013.

3.2. Temporal and Special Variations in Soil CO2 Efﬂux

The results of repeated-ANOVA showed that treatments, date of CO2 measurement
and their interactions had signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) effects on soil CO2 emissions from the treat-
ments (Table 1). Likewise, soil temperature and soil water content were also signiﬁcantly
affected by the treatments, sampling date, and their interaction.

The overall average of CO2-C ﬂux was signiﬁcantly greater in conventional tillage
with free grazing (CTFG) than all other NT treatments (Table 2). Compared to CTFG,
no-tillage with controlled grazing (NTCG) reduced soil CO2-C by 55% (3.2 ± 0.4 vs.
5.1 ± 0.6 g m−2 d−1). Furthermore, CTFG also emitted signiﬁcantly greater soil CO2-C by
21, 49 and 65% than no-tillage without crop residues mulching (NTNR), no-tillage with
no grazing (NTNG) and no-tillage with free grazing (NTFG), respectively. The soil CO2-C
efﬂuxes differed amongst the treatments during the wet seasons (October to April) but
were not signiﬁcantly different during the dry seasons (May to September). For example,
they showed up to 36% lower CO2-C in NTCG than CTFG during the wet seasons.

Soil CO2-C efﬂuxes under the treatments changed markedly over time but were
always much higher in CTFG, followed by NTNR, than other treatments during the ﬁrst
month (January) after soil tillage (Figure 1B). Furthermore, the variations amongst the
treatments mostly occurred in the hot and wet periods. However, CTFG showed much
higher cumulative CO2-C values than NTNR in the period after April 2014 (Figure 1C).
The ﬁnal cumulative soil CO2-C efﬂuxes were 36 and 23% higher in CTFG and NTNR,
respectively, than the average of the other treatments, which were signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

3.3. Effects of Management Practices on Soil Properties and Aboveground Biomass

As expected, SOCc, SOCs, Nc and Nc did not differ signiﬁcantly amongst the treat-
ments at the start of the trial in 2012 (Table 3). However, SOCc was 40% higher under
NTCG (30.2 ± 1.0 g kg−1) than NTFG (21.6 ± 0.4 g kg−1) in 2015. NTCG and NTFG had 52
and 9% higher SOCc than CTFG (19.7 ± 0.3 g kg−1), respectively; there were no signiﬁcant
differences among NTNG, NTNR and CTFG. The corresponding SOCs were 57% higher in
NTCG (18.8 ± 0.4 Mg C ha−1) than CTFG (12.5 ± 0.7 Mg C ha−1). On average, the SOCs
increased at 1.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in NTCG and at only 0.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in NTFG. While

Agronomy 2021, 11, 1421

8 of 15

the decrease in SOCs in CTFG was anticipated, it was surprising that NTNG and NTNR
also experienced declines in SOCs. NTNR experienced the fastest loss of SOCs at −0.4 Mg
C ha−1 yr−1. At the end of the study in 2015, NTNG (1.9 ± 0.1 g kg−1) had the highest soil
Nc, followed by NTCG (1.89 ± 0.1 g kg−1) and it was lowest in CTFG (1.6 ± 0.1 g kg−1).
However, there were no signiﬁcant differences amongst these treatments.

Penetration resistance was higher under NTCG and NTFG than under the other
treatments (Figure 2C). Surprisingly, CTFG had the lowest topsoil penetration resistance,
which was even lower than NTNG. NTNR also showed high penetration resistance. Soil
bulk density was less variable (Figure 2D). Overall, it was highest under NTCG and lowest
under CTFG (1.09 ± 0.02 g cm−3). However, the difference was not signiﬁcant (p < 0.05).
Aboveground dry biomass was signiﬁcantly lower in CTFR (5.4 ± 0.6 t ha−1 yr−1) and
NTNR (5.1 ± 0.8 t ha−1 yr−1) than the other treatments (Figure 3). NTCG, NTFG and
NTNG had much higher aboveground biomass production than CTFG.

The ﬁrst two axes (axis 1 and 2) of the principal component analysis (PCA), showing
the multiple relationships between soil CO2 efﬂuxes and soil factors, explained 97% of
the total variation in soil CO2 emissions (Figure 4). Axis 1 accounted for 89% of the
variance, while axis 2 accounted for the rest (8%). Axis 1 correlated positively to penetration

correlated positively to SOC content and stocks. The PCA results show tendencies of CO2-C
to increase with soil temperature and to decrease with the other studied soil properties.

stocks (Nc; Ns), soil temperature (ST), soil water content (SWC), penetration resistance (PR) and soil
bulk density (ρb) on the other side. N = 15.

4. Discussion

The results showing signiﬁcantly higher soil CO2 efﬂuxes from a freely grazed con-
ventionally tilled system (CTFG) than other practices (Table 2 and Figure 1) implied higher
C losses to the atmosphere under conventional tillage practices. Conventional tillage
stimulates soil CO2 efﬂuxes, which increases climate change severity, leading to negative
consequences on land productivity [24]. Several studies explained that tillage accelerates
SOC oxidation through increased soil aeration, putting crop residues in direct contact
with soils and exposing the aggregate-protected SOC to decomposers [18,46,47]. How-
ever, the effect of tillage on soil CO2 efﬂux varies greatly worldwide. For example, while
La Scala et al. [48] reported 73% higher soil CO2 efﬂux in tilled compared to no-tilled soils
in Brazil, Sainju et al. [49] reported a difference of only 2% in the USA. Such large varia-
tions could be explained by the different soil properties, climatic conditions and residue
managements [13].

No-tillage with no residues (NTNR) induced signiﬁcantly greater soil CO2 ﬂuxes
than no-tillage with controlled grazing (NTCG) (Table 1), which could be explained by
the lower soil temperature under NTCG (Figure 2). The lower soil temperature could,
thus, have deaccelerated the soil organic matter mineralization rate [50,51]. Crop residue
mulching under NTCG decreased the topsoil temperature because crop residue layers were
reported to increase the reﬂection of solar radiation, which acted as insulation between
the soil surfaces and the warmer (or cooler) atmospheric air [52,53]. This explanation is
consistent with the present study result showing an increase in soil CO2 efﬂuxes with soil
temperature, and also a decrease in soil CO2 efﬂuxes with soil water content (Figure 4),
which agreed with other study results [54–57]. These studies explained that the increase

in soil temperature at optimum soil moisture content stimulated soil microbial activities,
which subsequently increase CO2 emissions from the soil. Although the current study did
not investigate soil microbial activity, decreasing moisture tends to improve soil aeration,
promoting soil microorganism growth. However, the lower soil temperature under NTCG
and other NT systems with crop residue retention than that with CTFG and NTNR in this
study could also be attributed to the low thermal conductivity of the residue mulch [58].
Soil compaction also reducing soil organic matter mineralization [35,59] due to lim-
ited gaseous exchanges between the soil and the atmosphere. Topsoil compaction also
reduces dissolved soil C losses due to limited water inﬁltration rates [60,61]. In the current
study, topsoil compaction was more pronounced in NTCG and NTFG systems, which
involved livestock grazing. Coincidentally, these two systems showed tremendous po-
tential to sequester C. Soil compaction increases soil particle aggregation and physical
protection of SOC against decomposers [59,62]. The current study results are consistent
with Silva et al. [59], who reported 29% lower CO2 efﬂuxes from compacted compared to
less compacted soils, while Torber et al. [62] reported a difference of up to 65%. Interest-
ingly, the greatest C sequestration rate occurred in the NTCG system, characterized by
high crop residues (leftover after trampling and soiling by the livestock) and higher topsoil
compaction. The elimination of soil aggregate disturbance through no-tillage has positive
effects on the physical protection of SOC and the potential addition of C through livestock
excreta are also important attributes of the NTCG system with a signiﬁcant impact on
sequestering C into the soil.

Since the high stocking rate was associated with topsoil compaction in the current
and other studies [63,64], it follows that slight topsoil (0–0.05 m) compaction might help
to positively modify soil nutrient cycling and improve soil quality after all. However, soil
compaction using livestock could degrade the physical quality of many soils as it affects soil
properties such as penetration resistance, soil bulk density, inﬁltration rate, soil moisture
and soil temperature [60,65,66]. The impact of livestock trampling on soil compaction
seems to depend on the soil properties because other studies actually reported higher
soil bulk density and penetration resistance on tilled compared to non-tilled soils [66,67].
Moreover, the depth of trampling-induced soil compaction varies between 0.05 and 0.2 m,
depending on animal weight and soil moisture content [64].

The current study showed no signiﬁcant change of topsoil SOC in the NTNG system,
which agreed with several other studies [13,68,69], suggesting that crop residue retention
alone might have little to no positive impact on SOCs in the short term. Singh et al. [69]
reported a limited increase in topsoil C in reduced tillage systems after 30 years of experi-
menting with different straw management in the boreal region of Southern Finland. In a
global meta-analysis, Abdalla et al. [13] reported only 12% lower SOCc in tilled compared
to non-tilled systems when no crop residues were retained, and only a difference of 5%
when crop residues were retained. In contrast, other studies still pointed to great soil C
sequestration beneﬁts of crop residue retention in non-tilled systems [54,57,70].

The study results pointed to greater beneﬁts of integrating controlled grazing in NT
to soil C sequestration than other agricultural land management practices. The beneﬁts
were explained, mainly, by low soil temperature (due to high crop residue retention
following soiling of the residues by the livestock) and, to some extent, by topsoil (0–0.05 m)
compaction. The lower CO2 efﬂuxes from the compacted plots conﬁrmed the laboratory
ﬁnding by Chaplot et al. [35] using soils from the same experimental site. Chaplot et al. [35]
compacted the soils manually to different levels and incubated them before evaluating
CO2 emissions.

Overall, this study demonstrates that faster C sequestration rates than reported by
some previous studies [57,71] could potentially be achieved in the short term. In a re-
view article based on 254 data points directly comparing soil C between NT and tillage,
Six et al. [71] reported that signiﬁcant C sequestration could only be realized in the sec-
ond decade. The current study results suggest that NTCG can achieve signiﬁcant C
sequestration over a shorter period of time, as demonstrated by the accelerated topsoil

Agronomy 2021, 11, 1421

C sequestration rate after only three years of implementation. The calculated mean C
sequestration rate of 1.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (Table 3) was four times greater than the achieved
by direct sowing trials (i.e., 0.34 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) in tropical Brazilian [72] and temperate
North American soils [73]. However, it is not very judicious to directly compare the C se-
questration rates for the Brazilian and North American trials result soils cannot be directly
compared against the results of the current study because they are based on data from
different soil types, depths and crop types. Assuming a constant C sequestration rate from
the soil surface to one-meter depth, NTCG from the current study could store as much as
28 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Therefore, adopting NTCG could be one of the available solutions
to offset the annual net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, estimated at 11 Pg in 2014 [12].
However, care would still be required to limit the potentially negative effects of topsoil
compaction, especially with regard to root growth and soil erosion.

5. Conclusions

The current study was conducted on a smallholder farming system in South Africa.
The main aim was to compare soil CO2 efﬂuxes and SOC stocks among different tillage
types combined with different maize residue management practices. The ﬁrst conclusion
based on the current study results is that no-tillage combined with controlled grazing of
maize residues has potential to greatly decrease soil CO2 efﬂuxes from cropping systems.
The study showed 55% lower soil CO2 efﬂuxes from no-tillage combined with controlled
grazing of residues than conventional tillage combined with free grazing of residues.
The second conclusion is that no-tillage combined with controlled grazing of residues
can potentially achieve faster soil C sequestration rates in cropping systems than widely
reported by studies across the world. Results from many reduced tillage studies performed
across the world suggested that signiﬁcant soil C sequestration can only be achieved in
the long-term (i.e., after about 20 years of continuous practice); but the current study
demonstrated a possibility of signiﬁcantly increasing soil C sequestration rates in the short
term, by practicing a combination of no-tillage and controlled grazing of the crop residues.
The current study recorded a soil C sequestration rate of 1.4 Mg C ha−1 year−1 following
only three years of continuous practice of the no-tillage combined with controlled residue
grazing technique. This result was contrary to the negative sequestration rates observed in
no-tillage combined with no crop residue retention and conventional tillage combined with
free grazing, which was also characterized by signiﬁcantly lower aboveground biomass
production than no-tillage combined with controlled grazing of the residues. Therefore,
integrating controlled livestock grazing of crop residues (i.e., high-density stocking rate
for short duration) in no-tillage systems could be the best agricultural land management
strategy to mitigate climate change because it increases SOC stocks and aboveground
biomass production while at the same time reducing CO2 efﬂuxes. However, there is
a need to overcome the potentially negative effects of soil compaction due to the high
stocking rate involved. Further research is also still needed to evaluate the potential effect
of this technique on soil C sequestration in deep soil depths, other environmental and
soil conditions, as well as the emission of other GHGs such as N2O and CH4. It is also
important to implement true randomization of the treatments in future trials.
