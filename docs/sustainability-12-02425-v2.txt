Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) are key ecological indicators of soil
quality in a given landscape. Their status, especially in drought-prone landscapes, is associated
mainly with the land-use type and topographic position. This study aimed to clarify the eﬀect of
land use and topographic position on SOC and TN stocks to further clarify the ecological processes
occurring in the landscape. To analyze the status of SOC and TN, we collected 352 composite soil
samples from three depths in the uppermost soil (0–50 cm) in four major land-use types (bushland,
cropland, grazing land, and plantation) and three topographic positions (upper, middle, and lower)
at three sites: Dibatie (lowland), Aba Gerima (midland), and Guder (highland). Both SOC and TN
stocks varied signiﬁcantly across the land uses, topographic positions, and agro-ecosystems. SOC and

at Aba Gerima, which was mainly attributed to frequent and unmanaged plowing and extensive
biomass removal. Compared to other land uses, plantations exhibited lower SOC and TN stocks
due to poor undergrowth and overexploitation for charcoal and ﬁrewood production. Each of the
three sites showed distinct characteristics in both stocks, as indicated by variations in the C/N ratios
(11–13 at Guder, 10–21 at Aba Gerima, and 15–18 at Dibatie). Overall, land use was shown to be an
important factor inﬂuencing the SOC and TN stocks, both within and across agro-ecosystems, whereas
the eﬀect of topographic position was more pronounced across agro-ecosystems than within them.
Speciﬁcally, Aba Gerima had lower SOC and TN stocks due to prolonged cultivation and unsustainable
human activities, thus revealing the need for immediate land management interventions, particularly
targeting croplands. In a heterogeneous environment such as the Upper Blue Nile basin, proper

1. Introduction

Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) provide information on the impact of land
management on soil health. The SOC stock, which is a key component and the largest carbon pool
in terrestrial ecosystems, is strongly linked to nitrogen availability [1] and serves as an indicator
of soil quality [2]. SOC acts as a major source or sink for atmospheric CO2 [3–6]. Globally, soil is
estimated to store 3150 Pg C (1 Pg C = 1015 g C), which is four times greater than carbon storage in the
terrestrial plant biomass (650 Pg C) and atmospheric (750 Pg C) pools [7]. The size of the soil carbon
pool, however, is signiﬁcantly controlled by the balance between the input and output of carbon in an
ecosystem. Therefore, any change in the size of the SOC stock potentially aﬀects elemental cycling,
land productivity, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and thus global climate [7–9].

The amount of SOC in a terrestrial ecosystem is inﬂuenced by natural and anthropogenic
factors [10]. Human-induced land-use change causes a particularly substantial loss of SOC [7,11,12].
Land-use change is associated with ecosystem carbon change [13] and drives negative impacts on
climate and the environment. Numerous studies have shown that deforestation and land-use change
results in land degradation and poorer soil quality [8,14–16]. In Ethiopia, the conversion of natural
vegetation to croplands or plantations is increasing due to population pressure and socio-economic
drivers. This has implications for biodiversity decline, land productivity, desertiﬁcation, and SOC
dynamics [5,17–20]. According to Assefa et al. [5], conversion of natural forest to cropland in the
northern highland of Ethiopia accounted for 50% to 87% of the observed SOC reduction. Likewise,
Kassa et al. [21] reported that conversion of forest and agroforestry to croplands caused an annual
−1 in the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia. On the other
decline of SOC stock from 3.3 to 8.0 Mg ha
hand, reports on vegetation restoration of degraded lands in the region indicated that SOC is improved
by planting Eucalyptus trees [18,22,23] or establishing exclosures [24,25].

Generally, the soil of natural vegetation has higher SOC than croplands because of its higher
organic residue content [26]. However, the eﬃciency of SOC accumulation depends on the quality
and amount of organic inputs, decomposition rate in the soil [26], and topographic position [10,27].
Topography inﬂuences SOC mainly by altering the input and output of carbon via hydrological
processes, and it aﬀects soil erosion and sediment deposition [28]. The topographic position also aﬀects
water availability, temperature regime, vegetation distribution, and soil processes [15,29].

Recently, owing to their strong inﬂuence on the sustainability of natural and agricultural
ecosystems, the eﬀects of factors such as land use, topography, and their interaction on SOC and TN
stocks have attracted scientiﬁc attention at the small watershed scale [10,12,13,15,27,30]. At the regional
scale, climate is the dominant factor that controls SOC and TN stocks by inducing changes in soil
moisture, vegetation patterns, decomposition rate [31], microbial activity [32], and soil respiration [33].
Therefore, SOC and TN dynamics in the soil vary in response to environmental factors (both biotic and
abiotic), and are sensitive to changes in climate and the local environment [1]. Thus, understanding
soil carbon and nitrogen stock dynamics in diﬀerent agro-ecosystems as a function of topographic
position, land use, and their interaction is important for designing sustainable land management
options [22,27,34] that also contribute to food security [35].

The direct and interactive eﬀects of topography and land use on SOC and TN stocks are not
well studied in the landscape of Ethiopia’s Upper Blue Nile basin, which is also known as the
Abay River basin and covers an area of 173,000 km2 [36]. The climate of the region is tropical
highland monsoonal [37]. The region is characterized by fragile and drought-prone areas, with diverse

agro-ecosystems and severe land degradation. Although soil and water conservation practices have
been used since the 1980s [38], a reduction in vegetation cover [39,40] and soil erosion induced by poor
land-use management have become major challenges for ensuring food security [36].

The aim of this study was to assess the eﬀects of major controlling factors on SOC and TN stocks
in three agro-ecosystems of the Upper Blue Nile basin. The speciﬁc objectives were to (1) determine
how stocks of SOC and TN vary with topographic position, land-use type, and soil depth across
agro-ecosystems; (2) assess the interactive eﬀect of land use and topographic position on SOC and TN
stocks within and across agro-ecosystems; and (3) assess the current spatial distribution of SOC and
TN stocks in the three agro-ecosystems of the Upper Blue Nile basin.

2.1. Study Sites

The study was conducted in three diﬀerent agro-ecosystems of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
(Figure 1), namely Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie, representing the highland, midland, and lowland
agro-ecosystems, respectively (Table 1). According to Mekonnen [41], the four dominant soil types
(in the FAO classiﬁcation system) in the study area are Acrisols, Leptosols, Luvisols, and Vertisols
(Table 1).

wheat (Triticum aestivum), and potato (Solanum tuberosum) are grown. At Aba Gerima, teﬀ, ﬁnger
millet (Eleusine coracana), wheat, and maize (Zea mays) are cultivated. At Dibatie, maize, teﬀ, sorghum
(Sorghum bicolor), and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) are the major food crops [43,45].

2.2. Soil Sampling

Based on the available land-use types and elevation range of the watersheds (Table 1),
three topographic positions (i.e., upper, middle, and lower) were selected. Cropland and grazing land
are common in all topographic positions at the three study sites, whereas plantation (A. decurrens or
E. camaldulensis) at Dibatie and bushland in the lower position at all sites are not part of the current
land-use systems (Figure 1). In each topographic position, four replicated land uses were measured.
A total of 352 soil samples were collected from the three agro-ecosystems. The top 50 cm of soil was
sampled, divided into three soil layers of 0–15, 15–30, and 30–50 cm. Soil samples were collected from
ﬁve points, at the four corners and in the center of a plot (10 m × 10 m) using a hand-driven soil auger.
Soil samples collected from each plot from similar layers were thoroughly mixed to obtain a composite
sample (1 kg). Soil bulk density was determined separately by using a metal core cylinder (100 cm3),
which was inserted at the midpoint of the 0–15, 15–30, and 30–50 cm layers. All composite soil samples
were ﬁrst air-dried and then passed through a 2-mm sieve, packed, labeled, and transported to Japan
for chemical analysis at the Arid Land Research Center of Tottori University.

2.3. Soil Analysis

Soil pH and electrical conductivity were measured at a 1:5 soil-to-water ratio using a pH meter
(D-51, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) and conductivity meter (ES-51, Horiba), respectively. Bulk soil density

2.4. Determination of SOC and TN Stocks

Five-gram subsamples of homogenized soil from each soil depth were dried at 60

using a CN corder (Macro Corder JM1000CN, J-Science Lab, Kyoto Japan). Total carbon and nitrogen

Data with a non-normal distribution were transformed using square-root and log transformation
techniques. Two-way (within agro-ecosystem) and nested three-way (between agro-ecosystems)
analysis of variance were used to test the signiﬁcance of mean diﬀerences in SOC and TN content and
stock as dependent variables, while topographic position, land use, soil depth, and their interactions
(between two or three factors) were considered as driving factors. Diﬀerences in means between
groups were analyzed using Tukey’s HSD (honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence) test within the Agricolae
package (version 1.2-8). Statistical analyses were carried out in RStudio [48], an interface for the R
software program (version 3.4.4). The signiﬁcance level was set at alpha = 0.05.

3.1. Effect of Topographic Position on SOC and TN Contents and Stocks 

At Guder, SOC content in croplands increased significantly (P < 0.05) from the upper (10.96 mg 
g–1)  to  the  lower  topographic  position  (16.68  mg  g–1;  Figure  3a).  In  the  case  of  grazing  land,  SOC 
content decreased from 22.59 mg g–1 in the upper position to 14.57 mg g–1 in the middle position and 
then increased to 17.40 mg g–1 in the lower position. For bushland and A. decurrens plantations, SOC 
content did not vary among topographic positions. TN content for bushland decreased significantly 
from 2.87 mg g–1 in the upper position to 2.39 mg g–1 in the middle position (Figure 3d). However, TN 
in cropland and grazing lands were not significantly different across topographic position. 

At Aba Gerima, SOC and TN contents differed among topographic positions (P < 0.05; Figure 
3b, e). The TN contents of bushland (0.78 mg g–1), cropland (0.19 mg g–1), and Eucalyptus plantations 
(0.49  mg  g–1)  were  significantly  lower  at  the  upper  position  than  that  at  the  middle  and  lower 
positions. The highest contents of SOC (17.52 mg g–1) and TN (1.23 mg g–1) were in bushland at the 
middle position, whereas croplands in the upper position showed the lowest SOC (4.78 mg g–1) and 
TN contents (0.19 mg g–1).

of SOC stock at Dibatie, both SOC and TN contents and stocks at the three study sites were strongly
aﬀected by land use (p < 0.05). Likewise, the interaction between topographic position and land use
had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on both SOC and TN contents and stocks at Guder and Aba Gerima, whereas
no signiﬁcant eﬀect was detected at Dibatie (Table 2).

3.2. SOC and TN Contents and Stocks for Diﬀerent Land Uses across Soil Depths

Across soil proﬁles, both SOC and TN contents were slightly decreased from top to the lower soil

proﬁle at Aba Gerima (Figure 5b,e) compared with Guder (Figure 5a,d) and Dibatie (Figure 5c,f).

The SOC and TN contents at Guder (Figure 5a,d) and Aba Gerima (Figure 5b,e) varied signiﬁcantly
among land uses at all soil depths (p < 0.05). At Dibatie, except for TN contents in the lower soil depth,
there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in SOC and TN contents among land-use types at all soil depths
(Figure 5c,f).

At Guder, SOC and TN contents of bushland were signiﬁcantly higher than the other land uses in
all soil proﬁles (Figure 5a,d). At Aba Gerima, SOC contents in the 0–15 cm layer were 15, 11.3, and 6.7
times higher in bushland, plantation, and grazing land, respectively, than in cropland (Figure 5b).
However, in the 15–30 and 30–50 cm layers, the SOC content in bushland was signiﬁcantly greater than
that in the other land uses. Similarly, TN content in the 0–15 cm layer at Aba Gerima was signiﬁcantly

land, and plantation, respectively, than in cropland (p < 0.05). At Dibatie, there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in SOC content among land-use types at all soil depths (Figure 5c). However, TN contents
in the 30–50 cm soil layer were signiﬁcantly higher in bushland and cropland than in grazing land
(0.49 mg g

On the other hand, the SOC and TN stocks at Guder and Aba Gerima varied signiﬁcantly among
land uses within each soil proﬁle (p < 0.05; Table S1). Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in SOC stocks across soil
depths within each land-use type were observed at Aba Gerima and Dibatie, whereas TN stock only
varied signiﬁcantly at Dibatie (Table S1). SOC stocks of grazing land and plantations showed a 0.43-
and 0.44-fold decrease from the top layer to the lower layer, respectively, at Aba Gerima. The SOC
stock in cropland decreased signiﬁcantly across soil depths at Dibatie. TN stock in the 0–15 cm layer
was higher than at 15–30 and 30–50 cm soil depths at Dibatie, whereas no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
found in the TN stock between the 15–30 and 30–50 cm layers.

There was signiﬁcant variation in the C/N ratios of cropland, grazing land, and plantation among
sites (Table 3). The highest (17.52) and lowest (11.03) C/N ratios were those of grazing lands at Dibatie
and Aba Gerima, respectively. Eucalyptus plantations (12.15) showed a signiﬁcantly higher C/N ratio
than A. decurrens plantations (12.16). The C/N ratios in the upper position were signiﬁcantly higher at
Aba Gerima followed by Dibatie and Guder, whereas the C/N ratios in the middle and lower positions
were signiﬁcantly higher at Dibatie than at the other two sites (Table S2).

Bulk densities in bushland, cropland, and grazing land diﬀered signiﬁcantly among sites (p < 0.05;
Table 3), whereas those of plantations at Guder (A. decurrens) and Aba Gerima (Eucalyptus) were not

Dibatie (Table 3). The bulk density also varied signiﬁcantly among topographic positions (p < 0.05;

as compared to the upper position. Soils at Dibatie had signiﬁcantly higher soil bulk density in the
middle position (Table S2).

Overall, SOC and TN contents and stocks were strongly dependent on agro-ecosystem (p < 0.05),
land use (p < 0.05), and the interaction between agro-ecosystem and land use (p < 0.05; Table 4).
Topographic position (p < 0.05) also inﬂuenced SOC content, SOC stock, and TN stock, but not TN
content. In addition, the interaction between agro-ecosystem and topographic position aﬀected TN
content and SOC and TN stocks. TN content, SOC stock, and TN stock were also strongly dependent
on the interaction of agro-ecosystem, topographic position, and land use.

4. Discussion

4.1. Eﬀects of Land-Use Type on SOC and TN Contents and Stocks Across Topographic Positions

Climate, soil type, land use, and topography are the principal factors that control SOC and TN
distributions at a regional scale [49,50]. In a small watershed, however, soil type and climate variability
are commonly low [51]. Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed that land use and topography inﬂuenced the SOC and
TN storage in the three agro-ecosystems.

At Guder, the SOC content in cropland was signiﬁcantly increased (Figure 3a) from the upper to
lower topographic positions. In fact, the upper position of a watershed is often exposed to soil erosion,
serving as a source of run-oﬀ and sediment for the lower positions [10]. In cropland, particularly,
this situation has ampliﬁed the variation of SOC content in association with geomorphologic processes.
Cropland in the highlands is poor in vegetation cover and experiences soil disturbance due to tillage and
high biomass removal [5,22]. In contrast, SOC content in grazing land was signiﬁcantly decreased from
the upper to lower positions (Figure 4a). Less soil disturbance, greater vegetation cover, and organic
input from grazing animals would improve the SOC in the upper position. Similarly, Mekuria et al. [25]
reported better vegetation cover and biomass in communal grazing lands in the upper position
than in the lower position, which is more easily accessed by livestock that induce changes in SOC.
Zhu et al. [30] also found an increasing trend in SOC content for cropland and a decreasing trend in
grassland from the summit to the lower part of a watershed in China. A review by Deng et al. [52] of
studies conducted worldwide revealed that conversion of native vegetation to grassland signiﬁcantly
increased the SOC stock. In contrast, the SOC content in bushland and plantation at Guder were not
aﬀected by topographic position. This distribution pattern may be due to the generally good vegetation
cover in bushland and plantations, which may reduce soil erosion in the upper position, resulting in
similar SOC contents in the middle and lower positions. Likewise, Fu et al. [13] reported uniform SOC
contents under diﬀerent vegetative types along a hillslope on the Loess Plateau of China.

The TN content in bushland at Guder was higher in the upper than middle position, which was
probably due to the presence of a large number of native leguminous shrubs (e.g., E. abyssinica) and
trees (e.g., A. abyssinica and A. gummifera) in the bushland. These results correspond with the ﬁnding
of [21], who reported high TN content in native vegetation consisting of leguminous tree species.
−1) in the upper position than in the
TN stock of the grazing land was signiﬁcantly higher (13.11 Mg ha
middle and lower positions (Figure 4d), likely because grazing land in the upper position was recently
converted from bushland [40], which may have stored relatively high SOC and TN stocks.

At Aba Gerima, both SOC and TN contents were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent among land uses
−1,
(Figure 3b,e). SOC and TN contents in the middle position of bushland (17.52 and 1.23 mg g
respectively) were higher than those in the upper position. Similarly, a study conducted in northern
Ethiopia [53] reported higher SOC and TN contents in the middle position of natural vegetation.
Our results could be associated with soil erosion, which is a common problem in the study area and
elsewhere in Ethiopia [36,43]. Soil erosion often causes translocation of soil from the upper slope

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2425

12 of 18

to lower area and contributes to the loss of soil organic matter [15]. Many studies elsewhere in the
world [30,53,54] have reported that soil in sites of deposition has higher SOC and TN stocks.

At Dibatie, both SOC and TN contents in the upper position were signiﬁcantly aﬀected by land-use
type (Figure 3c,f), which could be due to greater anthropogenic pressures in the upper than in the
middle and lower topographic positions. Many members of the farming community live around the
lower part of the watershed and their livelihoods depend on the bushland. This results in continuous
removal of wood and bushland clearing for cropland and grazing land toward the upper position.
−1 higher and TN contents were
SOC contents in bushland and cropland were 16.12 and 15.22 mg g

deciduous tree and shrub species that commonly contribute large amounts of organic matter to the
soil. However, grassland is regularly burned, which substantially reduces the grass cover and induces
loss of SOC and TN contents [55]. In a study in Ethiopia, [56] reported that the natural vegetation in
Dibatie (Combretum–Terminalia) decreased as a result of ﬁre.
−1) to middle positions (75.50 Mg ha

With regard to land-use eﬀects, the SOC stock of grazing land soil decreased signiﬁcantly from
−1) at Guder. Soil bulk density in grazing
the upper (162.22 Mg ha
lands is relatively higher as a result of livestock trampling [22,24,57]. At this site, a bulk density of
1.18 Mg/m3 was recorded in the grazing land (Table 3). At Aba Gerima, a high SOC stock was stored in
the middle position of bushland. Similarly, at Dibatie bushlands showed higher SOC and TN contents
than those of the other land-use types.

4.2. Eﬀect of Soil Depth on SOC and TN Contents and Stocks

At Guder, SOC and TN contents at 0–15 cm soil depth in bushland were higher than those of other
land-use types (Figure 5a,d). Bushland comprises a sizable proportion of native vegetation, and the
bushes, shrubs, and trees contain a substantial amount of wood biomass with a lower decomposition
rate, which could improve the organic input and contribute more to soil SOC and TN. These results are
similar to those of previous studies [10,21] that reported higher SOC and TN contents in the surface
soil under native vegetation as compared to that of other land uses. Therefore, conversion of bushland
to another land-use type may cause a substantial amount of SOC loss from the surface soil, as reported
by studies conducted elsewhere [3,4,21].

Plantation (A. decurrens woodlot) contained lower surface SOC and TN contents than we expected
(Figure 5a,d). Tesfaye et al. [58] reported lower SOC and TN contents in A. decurrens plantations in the
central highlands of Ethiopia, which reﬂects the complete removal of plant residues from the woodlots.
The plantations were established on previous cropland areas, but due to prolonged soil disturbance
and soil erosion, this land was no longer able to support crop production. Thus, farmers had to change
the cropland to plantations as a result of poor soil fertility and degradation [59,60]. Because plantations
are commonly used for charcoal production, both the above- and belowground biomass is completely
removed at the end of a rotation cycle (~3–5 years). According to Sultan et al. [61], plantations have
high stand density (<1 m spacing), no understory vegetation cover, poor inﬁltration, and high runoﬀ,
all of which could contribute to their lower SOC and TN contents.

Similarly, in the 0–15 cm layer of Aba Gerima, cropland has signiﬁcantly less surface SOC and
TN contents than bushland, plantation, and grazing land (Figure 5b,e). This diﬀerence may be due
to croplands having less organic input than areas with more vegetation. However, plantations at
Aba Gerima had SOC contents comparable to those of cropland and grazing lands. These diﬀerences
in SOC content from the plantations at Guder are likely induced by the diﬀerences in species and
woodlot management. Unlike the Acacia plantations at Guder, the plantations at Aba Gerima consist
of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and tree harvesting operations do not include the belowground biomass.
A study in northern Ethiopia revealed that Eucalyptus plantations had a better potential to restore
SOC content than did cropland and grazing land [5,22], and [62] reported that the conversion of
cropland to Eucalyptus plantations ameliorates soil degradation in central Ethiopia. Moreover, Assefa

Sustainability 2020, 12, 2425

13 of 18

et al. [63] reported that the amount of ﬁne root biomass in Eucalyptus plantations was higher than that
of cropland and grazing land.

In the lower soil depths (15–30 and 30–50 cm) at Guder, SOC and TN contents were similar to
those of the surface layer, probably largely due to plant roots and exudates, dissolved organic matter,
bioturbation, and translocation of particulate organic matter [64]. This result is in line with the ﬁnding
of [62], who reported a similar trend across soil depths. At Dibatie, soil depth generally had no eﬀect
on SOC content, however in the lower depths TN content was higher in bushland than in grazing
land. This may be because of regular burning of the surface cover in woodland, which is the most
common soil fertility problem in the lowlands of northwestern Ethiopia [65], as well as leaching and
lower temperature in the subsurface layer [55].

Land use had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on both SOC and TN stocks across the entire 50-cm soil proﬁle
at Guder (Table S1). The topsoil layer of bushland stored signiﬁcantly greater SOC and TN stocks
than that of plantation, which may be largely due to less carbon input from litter biomass, roots,
and residues, including understory biomass in plantations [10,12,66,67]. At the lower two depths,
however, bushland and grazing land had the highest SOC and TN stocks. Similarly, at Aba Gerima,
SOC and TN stocks of cropland were lower than those of the tree- and grass-based systems of bushland,
plantation, and grazing land. Many studies have reported that cropland stores the lowest SOC and TN
stocks [27,52]. In the 30–50 cm soil layer, bushland also showed higher SOC and TN accumulation than
cropland (Table S1). At Dibatie, however, SOC and TN stocks were similar at all soil depths, except
for the TN stock in the lower soil depth. This could be due to the practice of burning woodland (as
discussed above).

4.3. Eﬀect of Agro-Ecosystem on SOC and TN Contents and Stocks

The SOC stock in bushland (141.19 Mg ha

Agro-ecology had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on SOC and TN contents and stocks (Table 4). The soil under
bushland and grazing land had lower SOC and TN contents at Aba Gerima and Dibatie than at Guder.
In diﬀerent ecosystems, climate strongly aﬀects the soil carbon and nitrogen by controlling vegetation
productivity and organic matter decomposition [68]. Guder had higher mean annual precipitation
and was cooler than the other two sites (Figure 2). Similar studies also reported that areas with high
mean annual precipitation and lower mean annual temperature tend to accumulate large amounts
of SOC and TN [5,49,68]. The SOC and TN contents in cropland were lower at Aba Gerima than at
Guder and Dibatie. This result clearly indicated that cropland at Aba Gerima had less organic input
and poor physical protection, including vegetation cover, which plays a substantial role in organic
matter stabilization in cultivated land [69]. In another study of agro-ecosystems of the Upper Blue Nile
basin, Ebabu et al. [43] reported greater soil loss for cropland at Aba Gerima than that at Guder and
Dibatie. However, plantations had similar SOC and TN contents at Guder and Aba Gerima.
−1) was greater at
Guder than at Aba Gerima. These values are comparable with previous reports of SOC stocks of 69–239
−1 in natural vegetation and grazing land to 50 cm depth in the northwest highlands
and 67–109 Mg ha
of Ethiopia [5,62], but they are markedly higher than the values reported by [12], who recorded
−1 to 50 cm depth in grazing and shrub land of northern Ethiopia,

respectively. These values are also lower than the estimated mean of tropical sites (216 Mg ha
−1; [70]). However, cropland had higher SOC and TN stocks at
and the global average (254 Mg ha
Dibatie than those at Guder and Aba Gerima, which could be related to the diﬀerent farming system
at Dibatie. Unlike at Guder and Aba Gerima, crop residues are not collected in the ﬁeld at Dibatie,
which could be contributing to the SOC accumulation. In addition, the bulk density in cropland at
Dibatie was higher than that at the other sites (Table 3). On the other hand, cropland at Dibatie is a new
land-use type, having been converted from woodlands (Combretum–Terminalia) recently. In southern
Ethiopia, [71] reported that soil under Combretum–Terminalia vegetation stored higher carbon stock
than the aboveground biomass.

4.4. Implications of SOC and TN Stocks as Indicators for Sustainable Land Management in the Upper Blue
Nile Watershed

At the watershed scale, the eﬀects of topographic position and land use on SOC and TN stocks
were not consistent. At Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie, topographic position and land use, land use,
and topographic position, respectively, were the dominant factors that aﬀected SOC stock (Table 2).
However, TN stock in all agro-ecosystems was aﬀected by topographic position and land use. Thus,
by maintaining the same land uses at Guder, both stocks of SOC and TN could be enhanced by
topographic position, whereas converting bushland and grazing land to A. decurrens woodlots would
likely diminish the SOC and TN stored in the soil. At Aba Gerima, conversion of cropland to Eucalyptus
plantation had a positive impact on SOC and TN [5,62]. Plantation had lower SOC and TN stocks due
to poor undergrowth and litter removal [72]. The interaction of land use and topographic position
showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect on SOC and TN stocks at Guder and Aba Gerima (Table 2), indicating that
the variation in topography and land use may simultaneously aﬀect diﬀerent soil processes including
soil erosion and the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter [10,30].

Across the agro-ecosystems, topographic position and land use were the main factors inﬂuencing
SOC and TN stocks, but agro-ecosystem also showed a signiﬁcant interactive eﬀect with topographic
position and land use on the SOC and TN stocks (Table 4). Among agro-ecosystems, SOC and
TN stocks were higher at Guder, followed by Dibatie and Aba Gerima (Figure 4). In addition to
vegetation composition, the hydrological regime, soil formation processes, and climate (temperature
and precipitation) are important factors that aﬀect the SOC [68], which in turn inﬂuences soil
respiration [33]. In this study, Guder has higher mean annual precipitation and lower mean annual
temperature (Figure 2a) than Aba Gerima (Figure 2b) and Dibatie (Figure 2c). Agro-ecosystems in
cooler and moister climates accumulate high SOC and have a low rate of soil respiration [33] and
limited microbial activity [50]. A warm and moist agro-ecosystem such as Dibatie, however, tends
to store moderate SOC stocks due to high biomass production (Table 1) and greater soil respiration.
Aba Gerima has low SOC and TN stocks, likely as a result of severe soil erosion, prolonged crop
cultivation, and poor land management. The C/N ratio varied from 11–13 at Guder to 10–21 at Aba
Gerima and 15–18 at Dibatie. The C/N ratio is commonly considered as an indicator of microbial
activity and quality of soil organic matter [73]. Similar to the SOC and TN stocks, the C/N ratio also
varied among land-use types, agro-ecosystems, and topographic positions.

5. Conclusions

This study clearly demonstrated that SOC and TN stocks varied signiﬁcantly across land-use types
and topographic positions of diﬀerent agro-ecosystems. Poor and environmentally damaging land
management practices tended to reduce SOC and TN in soil. Interactive eﬀects of topographic position
and land-use types on SOC and TN stocks were signiﬁcant at Guder and Aba Gerima. Bushland
at Guder accumulated a substantial amount of SOC and TN stocks. Cropland at Aba Gerima had
poor SOC and TN stocks. Compared to other land-use types, the soil of A. decurrens plantation was
the lowest in SOC and TN, due to high biomass removal and improper silvicultural management.
However, E. camaldulensis plantations at Aba Gerima had a positive impact on SOC and TN stocks.
Across agro-ecosystems, Guder and Dibatie accumulated larger SOC and TN stocks than those of
Aba Gerima.

Overall, land use was a crucial factor inﬂuencing SOC and TN, both within and across the sites.
However, the eﬀect of topographic position was more pronounced across watersheds than within them.
Aba Gerima showed lower SOC and TN stocks due to prolonged crop cultivation and mismanagement
of the landscape. This calls for immediate land management interventions, particularly targeting
croplands. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of assessing SOC and TN stocks when designing
evidence-based land management options in the Upper Blue Nile basin.
