The system Root herbivores can affect plant growth [43–45], reproduction comprised Brassica oleracea as the host plant; the belowground [46,47], density [46,48] and nutrient status [49,50] and thus may herbivore was the cabbage root fly Delia radicum; the aboveground strongly affect the quality and quantity of resources available to herbivores were the generalist aphid Myzus persicae, and the foliar herbivores [36]. This can have differential effects on foliar specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae; and at the third trophic level insects and their associated natural enemies.

Drought defences [10,14,62] involving the release of volatile organic stress partially reversed the negative effect of De. radicum on compounds (VOCs) following herbivore attack that enhance the parasitism by A. colemani (Figure 1a; Tukey’s HSD, P,0.05). effectiveness of natural enemies [63–67]. In response to insect Parasitism by D. rapae followed the same pattern, but the herbivory, plants release VOCs which can be used by natural difference between drought stressed plants with or without enemies of the insect herbivores to find their hosts [59]. The plant De. radicum was not significant (Figure 1a). VOC emissions induced by foliar herbivores can be influenced by b) Sex ratio. Sex ratio was significantly affected by the root herbivores [59] and drought stress [68]. These studies showed interaction between De. radicum treatment and parasitoid compound specific responses for natural enemies under biotic and species (F1, 75 = 7.35; P,0.01).

These plants may become less 75 = 215.93; P,0.001) were also significant for the sex ratio attractive to foraging parasitoids [74,75] and thus may interfere of both parasitoid species. The proportion of males of both directly with herbivore-parasitoid interactions [59]. species was significantly greater on drought stressed plants The behaviour and performance of natural enemies can be with De. radicum compared with well watered treatments influenced by their host, host diet, environmental factors (Figure 1b). Delia radicum increased the proportion of male D.
