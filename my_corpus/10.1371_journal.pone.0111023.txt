Abstract

This study presents an experimental approach to assess the relative importance of climatic and biotic factors as
determinants of species’ geographical distributions. We asked to what extent responses of grassland plant species to biotic
interactions vary with climate, and to what degree this variation depends on the species’ biogeography. Using a gradient
from oceanic to continental climate represented by nine common garden transplant sites in Germany, we experimentally
tested whether congeneric grassland species of different geographic distribution (oceanic vs. continental plant range type)
responded differently to combinations of climate, competition and mollusc herbivory. We found the relative importance of
biotic interactions and climate to vary between the different components of plant performance. While survival and plant
height increased with precipitation, temperature had no effect on plant performance. Additionally, species with continental
plant range type increased their growth in more benign climatic conditions, while those with oceanic range type were
largely unable to take a similar advantage of better climatic conditions. Competition generally caused strong reductions of
aboveground biomass and growth. In contrast, herbivory had minor effects on survival and growth. Against expectation,
these negative effects of competition and herbivory were not mitigated under more stressful continental climate
conditions. In conclusion we suggest variation in relative importance of climate and biotic interactions on broader scales,
mediated via species-specific sensitivities and factor-specific response patterns. Our results have important implications for
species distribution models, as they emphasize the large-scale impact of biotic interactions on plant distribution patterns
and the necessity to take plant range types into account.

Introduction

Understanding the causes of species geographical distributions is
a major research goal in ecology, often driven by the desire to
model future species distributions in a world undergoing climate
change. Sobero´n [1] summarized the main determinants of species
distribution, which apart
from a species’ dispersal capacity
comprise the physiological niche and biotic interactions. Depend-
ing on the species’ physiological niche [2,3], a fundamental range
of environmental, and in particular climatic conditions, defines the
suitable range for growth, reproduction and establishment of
populations
range of environmental
conditions is usually modified by biotic interactions, for example
owing to constricted tolerances in the presence of competitors or
herbivores [1,5]. The result
is the species’ ecological [2,3]or
realized niche [6], which is the environmental range of conditions
under which a species does occur in nature.

fundamental

[4]. This

Correlative species distribution models are based on the central
spatial
assumption that on broad geographic scales, species’
distributions are in equilibrium with climate, while biotic
interactions are of minor importance [7]. At the same time, is
has been emphasized that biotic interactions are important at local
scales, e.g. for presence and abundance in communities [1,8].
However, it has been recognized that detrimental biotic interac-

tions, such as competition and herbivory, have the potential to
limit plant distribution also on large spatial scales [9,10]. For
instance, Bruelheide & Scheidel [11] demonstrated that
the
altitudinal distribution of a montane plant species is restricted to
higher elevations because of
increasing slug herbivory in the
lowlands.

Impacts of biotic interactions on plant performance have been
demonstrated to change along climate gradients as for example
was proposed by the stress gradient hypothesis for competition
[12,13]. Thereby, competition should gain in relative importance
under benign climate conditions. For example, Loehle [14]
suggested that the northern range limits of North American tree
species are limited by cold tolerance, while competitive ability
should determine the southern range limits. This has also been
demonstrated with examples of
increasing competition with
decreasing altitude [15]. Similarly, other biotic interactions might
vary with climate conditions. For example, slug herbivore pressure
was shown to increase with decreasing altitude [16].

In addition to altitudinal and latitudinal climate gradients,
environments
in Europe are also structured by a distinct
longitudinal differentiation in climate. A strong gradient exists
from oceanic climate in Western Europe, with relatively narrow
annual temperature ranges and constantly humid conditions, to
continental climate in Eastern Europe, with large temperature

seasonality and low annual precipitation. Along this gradient, the
general physiological growth conditions for plants get harsher with
increasing continentality. The strong impact of this continentality
gradient on plant distribution is also evident in phytogeographical
classification systems that classify plant species according to their
geographic distribution along this gradient
into oceanic and
continental plant range types [17,18].

Species populations are expected to increase in performance,
the closer their locations’ growth conditions is to the species’
climate optimum [19]. Under the general assumption that species’
geographic distributions reflect their environmental requirements,
species should do better under conditions which are climatically
less peripheral. Testing this assumption for North American tree
species, Purves [20] found distinct differences in growth and
demographic rates between northern and southern peripheral
range sections when compared with the core area. Accordingly,
oceanic and continental plant species should perform better in
oceanic and continental climates respectively. On the other hand,
this view has recently been challenged as glasshouse experiments
revealed no clear differences between responses of oceanic and
continental species in respect to soil moisture levels and frost
hardiness [21,22]. However, multiple species field tests on plant
range type-specific adaptations are still missing.

If closely related plant species tend to be similar in their
in geographical
fundamental niche requirements, differences
limitation,
distribution patterns might be caused by dispersal
biogeographical history and biotic interactions. Differences in
biotic characteristics are probably responsible for the large amount
of unexplained interspecific variation in periphery-core compar-
isons of species performance [20]. As predicted by the stress-
gradient-hypothesis, plant-plant interactions can turn from com-
petition to facilitation with increasing abiotic stress [15]. Thus,
competition should be less intense in continental compared to
oceanic regions. Similarly, mollusc herbivory might also be
reduced in continental regions as slugs (e.g. Arionidae) show clear
preferences to more benign climate conditions [16]. Hence,
species distributed in continental regions may be less adapted to
negative biotic interactions and more vulnerable to biotic stress.
This mismatch might be disadvantageous in the climatically more
favourable oceanic regions. In consequence, detrimental biotic
interactions should have a different impact depending on the
species’ plant range type.

Based on these considerations a transplant experiment was set
up in nine Botanic Gardens along a continentality gradient in
Germany (Fig. 1), where the relative impact of biotic interactions
(competition and mollusc herbivory) and climate was tested with
congeneric plant species of contrasting plant range types. Such
transplant experiments have been used before and demonstrated a
strong climatic impact on the transplants’ survival, growth and
reproduction [23–25].

The following hypotheses were tested: H1) There is an
interactive effect between climate and biotic treatments on plant
performance. In particular, we expected the effect of competition
and herbivory to become weaker with increasing climatic
continentality. H2) At the oceanic end of the gradient, species
with general oceanic distribution should perform better than
species with general continental distribution range and vice versa,
indicating range type-specific adaptation. H3) Depending on the
plant range type, biotic treatments affect species differently, as the
continental plant species should be more susceptible to competi-
tion and herbivory. Furthermore, assuming that
the relative
importance of herbivory and competition decreases with increas-
ingly continental climate, the negative biotic effects on continental
species should decrease with increasing continentality. Testing

these hypotheses aims at improving the mechanistic understanding
of species distribution patterns.

Material and Methods

Ethics statement

The authorities that issued the permit to use the Botanical
Gardens were the scientific or technical directors of the gardens.
As they also assigned the piece of land to us, carrying out the
experiment without this permit would not have been possible.
Seeds for the experiment were collected from public land and all
regulations concerning protected or endangered species were
respected.

Climate gradient

To establish a climatic gradient for common garden locations,
we made use of the network of Botanical Gardens, as they provide
excellent conditions for reproducibility, and generally have similar
soil conditions,
i.e. fertile garden soils (hortisols). Additionally,
these gardens usually suffer from high mollusc densities, which
motivated us to manipulate mollusc herbivory as a negative biotic
impact. Using the geographic coordinates of 66 major Botanical
Gardens in Germany we extracted the mean values for mean
minimum temperatures of the coldest month and mean annual
precipitation for the last 50 years, using the WORLDCLIM
dataset [26]. We chose 12 gardens located along a gradient from
oceanic (mild winter and high precipitation) to continental (cold
winter and low precipitation) climate conditions. Out of these,
nine gardens responded positively to our request for conducting an
experiment (Fig. 1, Table 1).

For the study period (June 2008–October 2009), monthly mean
data for temperature and precipitation were obtained from the
nearest official meteorological
stations. Table 1 shows mean
temperatures as well as accumulated temperature and precipita-
tion sums at the nine study sites for the investigation period. To
analyze the weather conditions during the study period,
the
climate data of all nine Botanical Gardens were subjected to a
principal component analysis (PCA, prcomp procedure; R 2.15.2,
R Development Core Team 2012). In the PCA, the Botanical
Gardens were ordered along a clear gradient
related to
temperature on the first, and precipitation variables on the second
axis (explaining 53% and 28% of the overall variance in climate
conditions, respectively). Summer temperature of 2009 had the
highest loading and was positively correlated with the first PCA
axis scores (Table 1). The remaining temperature variables for the
vegetation period were also highly positively correlated with the
first PCA axis while precipitation variables and minimum
temperature were negatively correlated with this axis (Table 1).
Regarding the second PCA axis, summer precipitation in 2009
had the highest loading and was negatively correlated with the
respective axis scores (Table 1). The Botanical Gardens were
arranged from Osnabru¨ ck (OSN) to Frankfurt (FRA) and from
Frankfurt (FRA) to Braunschweig (BS) along PCA axis 1 and 2,
respectively (Table 1).

Transplants and measurements

Fourteen herbaceous species were included in the experiment,
two from each of seven genera. The two congeneric species are of
similar growth form, have similar habitat preferences (Table S1),
but differ in their geographical distribution range, in particular
with respect to the longitudinal positions of their western range
boundary (Figure S1). The following species were included in this
transplant experiment (taxonomy according Ja¨ ger & Werner [27],
plant range type as follows: oceanic-continental): Carlina vulgaris

deltoides - Di. carthusianorum, Inula conyzae - I. hirta, Koeleria
pyramidata - K. macrantha, Scabiosa columbaria -Sc. ochroleuca
and Silene nutans - Si. otites. The species are perennial plants
which are all native to Europe (see distribution maps in Figure S1)
and occur mainly in dry to semidry open grasslands [27]. All
species had already been investigated in other glasshouse [21,22]
and field experiments [28].

Seeds of all species were collected in summer 2007 in Central
Germany, using large populations to avoid negative effects of low
genetic diversity (for geographical coordinates of the sampling
localities see Table S1). Seedlings of all species were raised under
controlled standardized glasshouse conditions in spring 2008. In
June 2008, the young seedlings were transplanted into the plots.
To ensure initial establishment, plants were watered regularly for
one month. There were some species for which not enough
seedlings were available, resulting in three species pairs that could
not be planted in all gardens. These missing species pairs were
randomly assigned to all gardens, except for those at the ends of
the climate gradient which received all seven genera. We made
sure that no more than one species pair was missing in any of the
nine gardens.

At the beginning of the experiment, the leaf number of every
transplant was counted to calculate relative growth rates according
to Hunt [29]. At the end of the experiment, in October 2009,
survival, flowering status, number of leaves, number of flowering
units, plant height, specific leaf area (SLA) and the proportion of
consumed leaf area (visually assessed) were recorded. Additionally,
aboveground biomass was harvested and weighed after drying at
70uC for 48 hours.

Experimental setup

In every garden one study plot consisting of 16 subplots of one
by one metre area each was established (Figure S2). Each subplot
was divided in four rows and four columns, resulting in 16 planting
positions (Figure S2). One individual per plant species was planted
in every subplot at randomly chosen positions resulting in a
maximum of 14 transplants (and two empty positions) per subplot.
For the competition treatment, seeds of Festuca rubra (cultivar
Wilma, RUDLOFF Feldsaaten GmbH, Bad Schwartau, Ger-
many) were sown (5 g/m2) on eight subplots at the time of planting
of the transplants (Figure S2). All subplots were regularly weeded
except for Festuca rubra in the competition subplots. For the
mollusc exclosure we regularly applied a mollusc repellent
(Ferramol, W. Neudorff GmbH KG, Emmerthal) on eight of the
subplots. In spring 2009, these plots were additionally equipped
(IRKA, R+M
with metal
Gartenbedarf, Rehling, www.der-schneckenzaun.de). The compe-
tition and mollusc exclosure treatments were fully crossed and all
treatment combinations were replicated four times per Botanical
Garden (Figure S2), resulting in a total of 144 subplots and 1824
transplant individuals.

Statistical analyses

All response variables (survival, incidence of flowering, RGR of
leaf number, aboveground biomass, plant height, number of
flowering units, SLA and proportion of consumed leaf area
biomass) were analysed with separate generalized linear mixed
effect models (GLMM, proc glimmix, type III SS, SAS 9.2, SAS
Institute Inc. 2008). For survival and incidence of flowering, a
logit-link function and binomial error distribution were used, while
the GLMM for all other response variables had an identity-link

function and Gaussian error distribution. To identify the most
relevant climatic drivers of the different response variables we
included the scores of the first and second PCA axes as covariates
in the models. Fixed categorical factors in all models were plant
range type (oceanic, continental), competition (presence/absence)
and herbivory (presence/absence). All possible two and three-way
interactions of fixed factors and covariates were included. Subplot
identity (nested in the interaction of garden identity, herbivory and
competition treatment) and species identity (nested in plant range
type) entered the models as crossed random factors.

Unbiased least square means (LS means) and standard errors
were calculated using the LSMEANS statements in SAS 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc. 2008) and used to produce graphs. Tukey post-hoc
tests were calculated for contrasts between treatment combina-
tions. All graphs were produced with R 2.15.2 (R Development
Core Team 2012).

Results

Main effects of climate, competition and herbivory

The climate gradient significantly affected survival, above-
ground biomass, plant height, number of flowering units, SLA and
proportion of leaf area consumed (Table 2). While temperature,
which was captured by the first PCA axis, had no significant effect
on any response variable, precipitation, with high loadings on the
second PCA axis, played a major role. Survival (p = 0.005), plant
(p,0.001)
height
decreased with decreasing precipitation (i.e.
increasing PCA2
scores), while proportion of consumed leaf area increased
(p = 0.020). Additionally,

both PCA axes for survival
(p = 0.005), plant height (p = 0.038), number of flowering units (p,
0.001) and specific leaf area (p = 0.042, Table 2).

flowering units

The competition and mollusc exclosure treatments had strong
effects on all response variables except survival (Table 2). This
demonstrates that our experimental subplot manipulation of biotic
interactions was effective and that these two biotic factors were key
determinants of plant performance across all species. Competition
flowering (by 27.1%,
significantly reduced the incidence of
referring to LSmeans estimates from the GLMM, p,0.001), RGR
of leaf number (by 259.2%, p,0.001), aboveground biomass (by
240.8%, p,0.001) and number of flowering units (by 235.5%,
p,0.001). Furthermore, there was an increase in SLA (by +6.2%,
p = 0.022) and proportion of consumed leaf area (by +50.1%, p,
0.001) when competitors were present. Mollusc exclosure resulted
(by +3.5%, p = 0.031) and lower
in increased plant height
proportions of consumed leaf area (by 229.7%, p,0.001).
Additionally, proportions of consumed leaf area showed a
significant
interaction effect of competition with herbivory
(p = 0.004): While the mollusc exclosures reduced the amount of
consumed leaf area by 210.3% in absence of competition, the
reduction was 240.5% in presence of competition.

Interaction of climate with impacts of competition and
herbivory

In general, the climate gradient had no effects on the outcome
of the biotic subplot manipulations for most response variables
(Table 2). Along the first PCA axis (temperature) the competition
effect on number of flowering units changed (p = 0.043, Table 2).
With increasing temperature (i.e.
increasing PCA1 scores), the
number of
flowering units increased when competitors were
absent, while the number of flowering units remained unchanged
when competitors were present. The effect of mollusc exclosure
changed along the second PCA axis (precipitation) for incidence of

flowering (p = 0.027, Table 2). With decreasing precipitation (i.e.
increasing PCA2 scores) flowering was observed less frequently
when molluscs were excluded, while flowering increased in
frequency in the presence of mollusc herbivory.

Effects of plant range type and the interactions of plant
range type with climate, competition and herbivory

No significant main effects of plant range type were observed for
any of the response variables (Table 2). This also applied to SLA,
showing that the two representatives for plant range types did not
differ in basic functional traits. However, significant interactions
indicated that species of different plant range types responded
differently along the climate gradient and to the subplot treatments
(Table 2).

incidence of
flowering, aboveground biomass and
Survival,
flowering units were significantly affected by the
number of
interaction of plant range type with competition (Table 2). The
plants of the oceanic range type survived slightly better in presence
of competitors (+1.6%), whereas those of the continental range
type had clearly lower survival rates (29.0%) when competitors
were present (p = 0.025, Fig. 2A). Similarly, plants with continen-
tal range type flowered less frequently in presence of competitors
(27.7%), whereas flowering of oceanic plants remained nearly
unaffected by competition (20.9%, p = 0.030, Fig. 2B).
In
contrast, aboveground biomass (oceanic 247.9%, continental 2
flowering units (oceanic 2
32.6%, p = 0.008) and number of
40.5%, continental 227.0%, p = 0.017) were generally negatively
affected by competition, with stronger negative effects on plants
with oceanic than on continental range type (Fig. 2C,D).

With respect to the herbivory treatment, plant range type was
important for the incidence of flowering (p = 0.007) and propor-
tion of consumed leaf area (p = 0.027, Table 2). Plants of the
continental range type showed a decrease in the proportion of
flowering individuals (24.8%) in the presence of molluscs while
those of the oceanic range type displayed a slight increase (+0.6%,
Fig. 2E). Without mollusc exclosure, plants of the oceanic range
type were consumed more frequently than plants of
the
continental range type (Fig. 2F).

There were also threefold significant interactions of competi-
tion, herbivory and plant range type. The plant range types
displayed contrasting response patterns to herbivory and compe-
tition in survival (p = 0.028, Fig. 3A,B), plant height (p = 0.023,
Fig. 3C,D) and number of flowering units (p = 0.022, Fig. 3E,F,
Table 2). Survival and plant height of continental plants were
strongly negatively affected by the single effects of herbivory and
competition (Fig. 3B,D). These effects had the same magnitude
and were not additive when mollusc herbivory occurred in
combination with competition. Survival and plant height of
oceanic plants remained unaffected by the biotic treatments
(Fig. 3A,C). The contrasting pattern was observed for the number
of flowering units, where oceanic plants were strongly affected by
biotic interactions (Fig. 3E), while continental plants were not
(Fig. 3F). In oceanic plants, herbivory and competition had
opposing effects on number of flowering units. While herbivory
alone caused a significant increase in number of flowering units,
competition alone had no significant effect. However, when
competitors were present in addition to herbivores, the number of
flowering units of oceanic plants strongly decreased (Fig. 3E).
Neither RGR of leaf number nor the proportion of consumed leaf
area showed significantly different effects for the contrasting range
types in the presence or absence of herbivores or competition
(Table 2).

The responses to the climatic variables of plants of contrasting
range types differed for incidence of flowering (PCA2, p = 0.018,

Incidence of
flowering of continental plants decreased with
decreasing precipitation (i.e. increasing PCA2 scores) while that
of oceanic plants increased (Fig. 4A). Similarly, plant height of
continental plants decreased with decreasing precipitation) but
remained constant in oceanic plant species (Fig. 4B). At the moist
end of the gradient, plants of the continental range type flowered
more frequently and were taller than oceanic ones, while on the
dry end the pattern was reversed (Fig. 4A,B).

Furthermore, along the precipitation gradient, the effect of
incidence of
competition differed between range types
flowering (PCA2, p = 0.047, Fig. 4C) and aboveground biomass
(PCA2, p = 0.033, Fig. 4D, Table 2). For both response variables,
oceanic plants showed changed climate responses when compe-
tition was manipulated. Incidence of flowering and aboveground
biomass
strongly increased with decreasing precipitation (i.e.
increasing PCA2 scores) when competitors were absent (Fig. 4C).
In the presence of competition, oceanic plants showed only a slight
increase in incidence of flowering (Fig. 4C) and a decrease in
aboveground biomass with decreasing precipitation (i.e. increasing
PCA2 scores, Fig. 4D). In contrast, plants with continental plant
range type showed almost no changes in their climate responses
when competition was manipulated. With decreasing precipitation
(i.e. increasing PCA2 scores) incidence of flowering and above-

ground biomass of continental plants decreased, both in the
absence and presence of competitors (Fig. 4C,D).

Discussion

The climate conditions in our transplant experiment were
characterized by a distinct gradient from oceanic to continental
climate. Across all species included in our study, temperature was
less important for performance variation than precipitation. Plants
benefited from higher precipitation in terms of higher survival,
taller growth and increasing number of flowering units. Addition-
ally, plant growth and reproduction were strongly negatively
affected by competition and partly by mollusc herbivory,
indicating that competition was more detrimental than herbivory.
Biotic interactions affected all response variables except plant
survival. This indicates that the relative importance of biotic
interactions and climate differed among the different response
variables.

Effects of climate on biotic interactions

In our first hypothesis, we expected that the negative effect of
competition and herbivory is mitigated under the more stressful
continental climate conditions. This was not the case for survival
and plant growth. Biotic interactions only changed the response
along the climate gradient in the case of variables related to

flowering. Competition generally reduced aboveground biomass
and growth, irrespective of climate. Restrictions in water supply at
the dry end of the climatic gradient did not aggravate the effect of
competition, probably because target plants and competitors were
affected likewise. However, we also have to consider that the fertile
garden soils used in our experiment have affected the interaction
of climate and competition. While competition is expected to
become more pronounced under fertile conditions, drought effects
might have been reduced. In contrast to competition, mollusc
herbivory had no impact on biomass production and was
independent of the climate conditions in our experiment, except
for incidence of flowering. This does not confirm the results of a
recent global meta-analysis of Rodrı´guez-Castan˜ eda [30], who
found that the effect of general herbivory on plant performance
increased in moister ecosystems. Bruelheide & Scheidel [11]
described increased slug herbivory with decreasing altitude, which
was reflected in increasing temperatures, and overall, more benign
growth conditions. A potential explanation for this mismatch to
our results might be that the climate gradient used in our study
was not steep enough to evoke climate-dependent herbivory effects
on plant performance. Additionally,
the generally high slug

abundances in Botanical gardens might have uncoupled the
climate-herbivory relationship, which emphasises the need for
assessing mollusc densities in future studies. Given the large
distance between the experimental sites, we were not able to count
molluscs during rain events or to quantify mollusc activity [11,16].

Interaction of climate with plant range type

We secondly hypothesised that the changing climate conditions
in our study have a different impact on the transplants with respect
to their range type. The expectation that species of the oceanic
plant range type perform better at the oceanic end of the climate
gradient and those of the continental plant range type at the
continental end of
the climate gradient was not confirmed.
Instead, we even found opposing patterns with increased incidence
of flowering, plant height and aboveground biomass for continen-
tal plants under moister conditions and for oceanic plants under
drier conditions. These results support the outcome of previous
experiments in the field and the greenhouse, where analyses with
the same species set revealed similar responses to manipulated
climate change [28] or altered soil moisture conditions [21,22].
Nevertheless, at least for the continental species, we expected a

poorer performance in the more oceanic climate since the
setup covered an area extending beyond their
experimental
western distribution limit
the general
impression was that plants of the continental range type responded
stronger to the climatic gradient than those of the oceanic range
type, especially with plant height. In contrast to our findings,
numerous transplant experiments have described a decreased
fitness beyond a species’ current range [31]. However, most of
these species’ range boundaries were studied along latitudinal or
altitudinal climate gradients [32,33], where temperature is the
dominant driver. In contrast, the climate gradient covered in our
experiment
favour
growth rates are counteracted by increasing drought
risk.
Consistent with our results, Stanton-Geddes et al. [34] observed
fitness declines towards the northern range edge but not to the
western range edge of Chamaecrista fasciculata, a widespread
annual legume from North America. However, we also have to
consider that short-term experiments, as presented here, might
perhaps not be able to detect clear home-site advantages. For
example,
in a transplant experiment monitored over 30 years
Bennington [35] encountered increasingly stronger home-site
advantages for ecotypes of two arctic plant species with time.
Our study design also did not allow for assessing the impact of
focus on
climate on population demography as we did not
recruitment. Given that our species are almost all
long-lived,
although some of them are hapaxanth (Table S1), a 2 years-study
period is certainly not sufficient to estimate the impact of climate

on long-term survival and demography. This clearly underlines the
need for long-term studies.

Interaction of competition and herbivory with plant

When climatic factors failed to explain species range limitation,
biotic interactions have often been made accountable for directly
limiting distribution ranges [31,36]. For example, Engels & Jensen
[37]
from salt marshes performed
similarly well
in both freshwater and saltwater marshes, when
competition was excluded. Similarly, in our experiment, plants
with continental range type survived much better in absence of
competition than those with oceanic plant range type. In addition,
continental plants flowered more frequently when competitors or
herbivores were removed or excluded, respectively. This sensitivity
to competition and herbivory of continental plants was not
modified by climate. This indicates that the geographic distribu-
tion of continental plants is not directly limited by climate
conditions but by other factors, such as competition. However,
biotic interactions might act on different spatial scales. In a tundra
study system Le Roux et al. [38] found that small scale species
distribution was shaped by horizontal biotic interactions (i.e.
competition) rather than by vertical interactions (i.e. herbivory).
Similarly, our experimental evidence on survival and incidence of
flowering supports our third hypothesis stating that continental
plants are more vulnerable to competition and herbivory than

oceanic plants. However, oceanic plants were stronger negatively
affected by competition in biomass and flower production than
continental plants. Regarding these inconsistent results, the third
hypothesis
that continental plants are more susceptible to
competition or herbivory has to be rejected.

Although individuals of both plant range types suffered from
biotic stress, they showed different strategies to cope with that.
Particularly, the combined effect of competition and herbivory
caused different plant responses with respect to plant range type.
Only plants of continental range type displayed lower survival
rates and smaller plant height in presence of competitors and
herbivores. In contrast, oceanic plants were significantly affected
in their flower production by herbivory alone and in combination
with competition. The reduced flower production of the oceanic
the compensatory response to
plants might be an effect of
herbivory and demonstrates a shift
in resource allocation to
enhanced plant growth [39]. Further reproductive traits such as
number of seeds, seed mass and seed dispersal mode, have also
profound effects on plant persistence [40] but could not be
assessed in our experiment. Nevertheless,
survival of plant
individuals is ecologically essential to maintain a population. A
synthesis of all our results indicates, that continental plants run a
higher risk to suffer from competition and herbivory than oceanic
plants, particularly if they are subjected to the combination of both
competition and herbivory.

Conclusion

From the results of our experiment we can conclude that, at the
geographical scale of Germany, the continentality gradient is of
minor direct importance for species of the considered plant range
types compared to negative biotic interactions. Competition and
herbivory affected particularly the performance of individuals of
continental plant range type. There was only weak evidence for
the assumption that the impact of competition and herbivory
should vary with climate. In consequence, predictions of future
geographic range dynamics of plants species have to be considered
with caution, especially when based solely on occurrence data and
climatic variables. Mechanistic models would be more suitable,
but to devise such models a better understanding of plant ecology
is needed [41]. Consequentially, Wisz et al [42] recommended
targeted long-term field monitoring approaches. Such long-term
field experiments should not only include species of different plant
range types but also measure demographic rates, which requires
the assessment of sexual and vegetative recruitment.

Acknowledgments

to all

We are very grateful
the participating Botanical Gardens for
providing space for the establishment and help for the maintenance of the
experimental plots, especially (sorted by the Botanical Gardens): W. Lobin
and J. Manner (Bonn), M. Kraft (Braunschweig), M. Wessel (Frankfurt a.
M.), M. H. Hoffmann and A. Fla¨ schendra¨ ger (Halle), S. Arndt (Jena), R.
Omlor and B. Meyer (Mainz), H. Voigt (Mu¨ nster), N. Friesen and H.
Bru¨ggemann (Osnabru¨ ck), M. Burkart and K. Kla¨ ring (Potsdam). We are
also indebted to all technicians and student helpers who conducted field
and lab work, particularly M. Baudis and S. Kosellek. Seed collection was
assisted by V. Bremerich, J. Danihelka and J. Stolle. M. Hofmann was a
great help in raising the plants. The manuscript was significantly improved
by the comments of John Stanton-Geddes and another anonymous
reviewer.
