Abstract

Disturbance is a key factor shaping species abundance and diversity in plant communities. Here, we use a mechanistic
model of vegetation diversity to show that different strengths of r- and K-selection result in different disturbance-diversity
relationships. R- and K-selection constrain the range of viable species through the colonization-competition tradeoff, with
strong r-selection favoring colonizers and strong K-selection favoring competitors, but the level of disturbance also affects
the success of species. This interplay among r- and K-selection and disturbance results in different shapes of disturbance-
diversity relationships, with little variation of diversity with no r- and no K-selection, a decrease in diversity with r-selection
with disturbance rate, an increase in diversity with K-selection, and a peak at intermediate values with strong r- and K-
selection. We conclude that different disturbance-diversity relationships found in observations may reflect different
intensities of r- and K-selection within communities, which should be inferable from broader observations of community
composition and their ecophysiological trait ranges.

Introduction

The level of disturbance is one of many factors that shape
patterns of plant species diversity [1]. The Intermediate Distur-
bance Hypothesis (IDH) [2,3] states that
the diversity of a
community is greatest at intermediate levels of disturbance. This
peak in diversity is hypothesized to result from the contrasting
effects of disturbance on the ability of species to persist in a
community. Greater rates of disturbance require more rapid
recolonization of sites, which should exclude species that are slow
in reproduction, thus decreasing the diversity in a community.
However, with decreasing rates of disturbance, strong competitors
increasingly outcompete weaker competitors, resulting in in-
creased levels of competitive exclusion and lower levels of diversity.
Thus, the combination of the two effects suggest a peak in diversity
at intermediate levels of disturbance, resulting in a unimodal
disturbance-diversity relation (e.g. [4,5]).

The IDH and, more generally, disturbance-diversity relation-
ships (DDRs) can be interpreted as the outcome of how well
species are able to compete and colonize under different rates of
disturbances. This ability is not arbitrary, but constrained by the
colonization-competition tradeoff to which all plant species in a
community are subject to. Plant species differ in their traits, which
influence their competitive and colonizing abilities. A plant species
that produces high biomass has a greater ability to harvest light
and reach other resources and thus has a strong competitive
ability. Such a strategy is favored by K-selection [6] In contrast, a
plant strategy that allocates more to reproduction instead of
biomass can rapidly establish on free sites, thus having a greater
colonizing ability. Such a strategy is favored by r-selection [6].

Since plants cannot be both strong competitors and quick
colonizers, they are subjected to the fundamental tradeoff between
allocation to biomass and reproduction. Hence, the colonization-
competition tradeoff is seen as the main mechanism that results in
the IDH (e.g. [7]). Although we constrain our discussion here to
plants, it should in general apply to other organisms, e.g. animals,
because the colonization-competition tradeoff should also apply to
them.

The universality of the IDH has been tested for a wide range of
empirical systems (e.g. [8–11]) and with theoretical studies (e.g.
[4,12]). The unimodal DDR associated with the IDH has not been
consistently observed (summary in [10]). The relationship of
diversity with disturbance rate can also be U-shaped, increasing or
decreasing, or even insignificant (e.g. [10,13]). Several alternative
explanations have been proposed to explain these different shapes.
Huston [14], Proulx and Mazumder [15] and Kadmon and
Benjamini [16] explained different DDRs with an interdepen-
dence of productivity between different species. Following this
idea, a unimodal relationship between diversity and disturbances
can be realized only under intermediate levels of productivity (e.g.
[16,17]). They suggest
that with high productivity, diversity
increases with disturbances, while under low productivity, diversity
decreases with disturbances. However, productivity and diversity
are not independent variables, but reflect different aspects of the
environment,
the disturbance regimes as well as the level of
competition within communities. Due to such inconsistencies, Fox
[18] has suggested to abandon the IDH. However, in this paper
we do not want to reject or support the IDH, rather we seek a

range, because it shifts from competitors towards colonizers under
increasing disturbances. The abundances of colonizers versus compet-
itors (B) reflect these relationships and lead to different shapes of DDRs

general theory to explain the different shapes of DDRs, which is
still missing [19].

in terms of

Here, we hypothesize that different shapes of DDRs result from
different strengths by which r- and K-selection exclude species
from plant communities. We test this hypothesis with a model in
which the strength of r- and K-selection can indirectly be adjusted,
for instance by the disturbance rate. The composition of the
modelled plant community, e.g.
the relative
abundances of colonizers and competitors, results from different
independent processes: climatic constraints, disturbance, and
competitive processes. We refer to strong K-selection if we observe
a high presence of competitors. This is usually the case under high
resource competition. We refer to strong r-selection if we observe
high presence of colonizers, which is usually the case under strong
seed competition. Seed and resource competition can be adjusted
in the model independently varying two parameters. By altering
the seed and resource competition in the model, the resulting
community reflects different strength of r- and K-selection. We
therefore refer to the strength of r- and K-selection and not to seed
and resource competition.

traits to persist

With no competitive exclusion, the neutral theory of biodiversity
[20] assumes that differences among species are irrelevant to their
success, so that neither r- nor K- selection exclude species from a
community. At this extreme, the competition-colonization tradeoff
allows species over a broad range of
in the
community (Fig. 1 A), because r- or K-selection do not exclude
sections of this tradeoff. Since the success of species is independent
of their differences, we hypothesize that colonizers and compet-
itors should be present at a similar abundance (Fig. 1 B), thus
resulting in a flat DDR (Fig. 1 C). We expect that K-selection
results in a reduction of the range of the competition-colonization
tradeoff due to competitive exclusion. Thus, we expect colonizers
to be absent at low disturbances and become increasingly present
at higher disturbance rates. We hypothesize that this isolated effect
of K-selection results in an increase in diversity to a saturating
value with increasing rates of disturbance. With r-selection, we
expect to find the competition-colonization tradeoff to be reduced
towards the other end, favoring colonizers at the expense of strong
competitors. We propose that this results in a greater abundance of
colonizers towards higher disturbance rates, but also reduces the
diversity at this end because competitors are increasingly excluded.
Thus we expect diversity to decline with greater disturbance rates.
When both r- and K-selection are considered, we hypothesize to
find a less reduced range of the competition-colonization tradeoff
and a continuous shift in the abundance from competitors to
colonizers, resulting in the unimodal DDR that is associated with
the IDH.

To evaluate these hypotheses, we use a plant physiology-based
numerical model of plant diversity (JeDi-DGVM [21,22])
in
combination with a model of population dynamics (DIVE [23]).
The JeDi-DGVM tests a wide range of plant growth strategies for
their reproductive success under different climatic conditions and
thereby represents a mechanistic climate filter [24]. It has been
used successfully in previous studies to understand biogeographical
patterns of plant
relative abundance
distributions [26], as well as vegetation productivity [22]. The
model is used here as a mechanistic way to obtain the range of the
colonization-competition tradeoff for a given climatic setting. The

species, while r-selection shifts this tradeoff towards colonizers. Under
both r- and K-selection, the tradeoff (A) is hypothesized to have a wider

DIVE model [23] represents a competitive filter, in which we can
vary the strength of r- and K-selection as well as disturbance rate
and evaluate their effects on the resulting simulated diversity of the
community. With this we estimate the effects of r- and K-selection
on the resulting DDRs.

In the following, we first provide a brief description of the two
models in the methods section, describe the setup as well as the
analysis of simulations for the sensitivity analysis. The simulation
results are presented in a similar way as the line of reasoning was
presented in Fig. 1. We then describe potential limitations of this
approach and interpret the results in terms of our hypothesis and
close with a brief summary and conclusion.

Methods

We use two simulation models to test our hypotheses. The first
model tests many hypothetical plant growth strategies for their
success under given climatic conditions, acting as a ‘climate filter’.
Then, these successful growth strategies are applied to a second
model, which acts as a ‘competitive filter’. In a third step this data
is analyzed. The approach is summarized in Fig. 2.

Step 1: The climate filter

The first step represents the climate filtering of a wide variety of
potential plant growth strategies for their reproductive success.
This filter is implemented by the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global
Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM, see Fig. 3 left, [21,22]). JeDi-
DGVM is developed out of the individual-based KM2000 model
[21].

populations of individuals. JeDi-DGVM simulates plants as plant
growth strategies in terms of several carbon pools associated with
leaves, stem, roots, and reproduction and in terms of
their
physiological processes of photosynthesis, respiration, resource
allocation to different biomass pools as well as reproduction, and
phenology. The simulated processes are affected by the climatic
conditions and by a set of functional trait parameters. The climatic
condition, particularly solar
temperature and soil
moisture are used to simulate land surface processes, such as
canopy interception, infiltration, evaporation, root water uptake,
and runoff. The land surface parameters (e.g. leaf area index,
surface albedo, and rooting depth) are derived from the biomass
pools and from the functional trait values of each growth strategy.
The functional trait paramater values are randomly sampled from
a potential trait space comprising the theoretical ranges of 15
functional trait parameters. These functional traits include, for
instance,
the relative allocation to different carbon pools,
ecophysiological tradeoffs, and phenological responses and thereby
control plant growth and life history. Competition between growth
strategies, however, is not simulated by the model.

We simulated a large number of trait combinations of randomly
chosen values using a realistic climatic forcing and evaluated these
combinations for their reproductive success. These successful
strategies were then used in Step 2.

Step 2: The competition filter

The second step represents the explicit simulation of population
dynamics using the successful plant growth strategies from Step 1.

representation of population dynamics. It has been previously
shown to adequately reproduce successional patterns [23].

DIVE is based on the concept of

theoretical population
dynamics models (see e.g. [27]), while processes are represented
more mechanistically and the demographic parameters in more
realistic (see [23] for full model description). The DIVE model
simulates the abundances of the successful plant growth strategies.
The abundance of a plant growth strategy is represented as
differential equation (see Eq. 1) of the change in occupied area dAi
based on a species establishment Si on bare ground, invasion Ii
and exclusion Ei by competition for occupied area and mortality
Mi.

these processes itself

Each of
is represented by a differential
equation. Since the invasion and exclusion depend on the
occupied area of the affected species, the differential equations
cannot be solved analytically. Therefore DIVE has
to be
calculated step by step.

The simulated population dynamics (eq. 1) are affected by the
performance (Step 1) of the different plant growth strategies. For
instance, the simulated allocation to reproduction and the growth
rate determine its colonizing ability - thereby growth rate is a
surrogate on how fast a plant reaches adult size. Further, the
biomass turnover relates to the mortality of a strategy, and the
simulated biomass of a particular strategy determines its compet-
itive ability. Hence competition for resources is modeled implicitly
by biomass dominance and results
in K-selection. As an
approximation, we assume that size matters, in that larger plants
will typically outcompete smaller ones, e.g. due to being better
competitors for light, water or others resources (e.g. [28]). Of
course, this assumption may not be true for all cases, but in general
it should.

Figure 2. Schematic diagram of our approach, in which we use
two simulation models. The first model, the JeDi-DGVM, represents
the climatic filter that estimates the plant growth strategies that are
potentially able to be reproductively successful
in a given climatic
environment. The second model,
the DIVE model, simulates the
population dynamics of these plant growth strategies and represents
a competitive filter. The strength of r- and K-selection and the rate of
disturbance are external model parameters. DIVE calculates the
abundance of the plant growth strategies, from which the coloniza-
tion-competition tradeoff, the abundance of colonizers and competitors
and the diversity-disturbance relationships are being derived.

Selection Shapes Diversity-Disturbance Curves

Figure 3. Schematic diagram of JeDi-DGVM (adopted from [22]) and DIVE. JeDi-DGVM simulates the development of many randomly
sampled hypothetical plant growth strategies. Each plant growth strategy consists of trait parameters, that characterize plant carbon allocation,
phenology, and other ecophysiological attributes. The plant growth strategies develop based on fundamental ecophysiological processes (e.g.
photosynthesis and allocation) and the environmental conditions. The environmental conditions are provided by land surface processes, which are
simulated out of the climatic conditions. Functional tradeoffs and the prevailing climatic conditions ultimately determine the relative performance of
the growth strategies. DIVE uses the performance parameters of the surviving growth strategies to calculate rates of establishment, invasion and
exclusion and mortality, which in turn results in the relative abundance of each growth strategy in the community. Thereby r-selection, K-selection
and disturbances affect the spatial dynamics. The resulting abundances feed back into JeDi-DGVM.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095659.g003

We used several performance traits [29], such as biomass, seed
flux, productivity, and biomass turnover, to derive demographic
parameters, such as growth and mortality rates for the population
dynamics (see [23] for details).

In addition, the dynamics of establishment, competition, and
mortality are affected by externally prescribed parameters relating
to the strengths of r- and K-selection as well as the disturbance
rate. The strength of r-selection is mediated by a parameter cR1,
which affects the importance of the seed flux in the rate of
establishment of a particular plant growth strategy. In the absence
of r-selection (cR1 is high) the magnitude of the seed flux of a
particular strategy does not influence the rate of its establishment.
Under strong r-selection (cR1 is 1), the strategy with the highest
seed flux has the highest potential
to establish. The realized
establishment rate is also dependent on the growth rate, so that a
colonizer, or r-strategist, is characterized by a high seed flux and a
high growth rate. The strength of K-selection is mediated by a
parameter cR2, which determines the importance of the biomass of
a strategy for competitive exclusion. In the absence of K-selection
(cR2 is high) differences in biomass among strategies do not result
in competitive exclusion. With strong K-selection (cR2 is 1),
exclusion is proportional to the difference in biomass among
different strategies (with the assumption that strategies with higher
biomass are more dominant). Hence, a strong competitor, or K-
strategist, is characterized by a high biomass. The disturbance rate
is a parameter cMORT which acts to uniformly increase the
mortality and thereby reduces the abundance of all simulated
strategies. The higher the disturbance rate,
the greater the
reduction in abundance. The disturbance rate is modeled in this
simple way, because we are interested in the general effects of
disturbances. The continuous rate captures different disturbances
in one rate, e.g. disease, herbivory, grazing, fire, windfall. This
usage stays in contrast to the definition of White and Pickett [30],
who defined disturbance as
‘‘any relatively discrete event’’.
However, looking at the big picture over larger areas, discrete
disturbance events might considered a continuous phenomena.
Further, modeling all disturbance types in a process-based way is
still not feasible in models. The continuous disturbance rate used
here allows us to investigate the general effects of disturbances.

Step 3: Analysis

The simulated abundances from Step 2 are analyzed to infer the
colonization-competition tradeoff,
the relative abundance of
competitors and colonizers, and the diversity of the simulated
community to test the hypotheses shown in Fig. 1.

The colonization-competition tradeoff is derived directly from
the different successful plant growth strategies which pass both the
climate and competitive filters. We use the simulated biomass of
these strategies as an indicator for the competitive ability of a
strategy, and the simulated growth rate as an indicator for its
colonizing ability.

To classify the simulated strategies in terms of competitors or
colonizers, we use the distribution of simulated growth rates of the
different strategies as a basis (see Fig. 4). We define colonizers to be
strategies that are in the top 1/3 quantile of the distribution, while
competitors are taken to be those strategies that are in the bottom
1/3 quantile. We refer to the middle quantile as intermediate
strategies. We want to clarify at this point, that of course all
strategies compete, but we use this classification to especially refer
to strategies having a better colonizing or competitive ability.

To infer DDRs, we measured the diversity of the resulting
steady state community. In our model setup, a steady state
community is reached, while under disturbances this is not
expected. However, under disturbances stable coexistence, which
means that abundances do not show long-term trends [1], can
occur, especially when applying on the large scale. From a stable
coexisting community diversity can be calculated, in this way the
reader should understand the steady state community. Diversity is
calculated as Shannon information entropy (H) from the relative
abundances of the successful strategies (pi): H~{ P
This measure has the advantage that species with a very low
abundance contribute very little to diversity, in contrast to other
metrics like species richness. We normalized the diversity by the
maximum diversity across all the simulated communities, resulting
in the so called evenness. The evenness allows to compare results
easily, because the scales are set between zero and one.

temperature of 26.3uC. We tested a set of 500 initial randomly-
sampled plant growth strategies. The JeDi-DGVM was run for 70
years, so that the characteristics of each strategy represent the
mean properties of an adult population. The simulated properties
were used to run the DIVE model. The simulated abundances
from the DIVE model were returned to the JeDi-DGVM at a
monthly time step to establish a feedback between population
dynamics and the computation of seed production in the JeDi-
DGVM (but see Fig. 3). This setup was run for a total of 100000
years to ensure steady state composition of the community.

We conducted a number of simulations for the sensitivity
analyses with this model setup by modifying the parameters that
mediate the strengths of r- and K-selection (cR1 and cR2) as well as

The colonization-competition tradeoff

The simulated colonization-competition tradeoff for different
strengths of r- and K-selection for low and high disturbance rates is
shown in Fig. 5. In the absence of both r- and K-selection, the
colonization-competition tradeoff spans the widest range (Fig. 5a

and e). Since neither competitive nor colonizing ability can
increase the abundance of a particular growth strategy due to the
lack of r- and K-selection in the model, the simulated abundances
are entirely determined by the growth and mortality of
the
different growth strategies. The colonization-competition tradeoff
is very similar in terms of range and abundances under low and
high disturbances. The most abundant strategy in both cases is
classified as a colonizer.

When r-selection is included in the simulations, the tradeoff is
strongly constrained to a narrow range (see Fig. 5b and f). Both
strong competitors as well as quick colonizers are excluded in the
simulations, and the resulting strategies are mostly classified as
intermediates. In the model, this results from the combined need
of high seed production as well as high growth rate to be an
effective colonizer.

With strong K-selection, the range of the tradeoff is hardly
different compared to the case of no r- and no K-selection (Fig. 5c
and g). In contrast to the case of no r- and K-selection, the
strategies of highest abundance is clearly different in the cases of
low and high disturbance. In the case of low disturbance, the most
abundant strategy is a strong competitor with high biomass and
low growth rate. In the case of high disturbance,
the most
abundant strategy is a colonizer with a relatively high growth rate.
With both strong r- and K-selection, the range of the tradeoff is
reduced compared to the case of no r- and K-selection (Fig. 5d and
h), but wider compared to the case of only r-selection. The most
abundant strategy in the case of low disturbance rate is a strong
competitor as in the case of only K-selection, while in the case of
high disturbance, the most abundant strategy is shifted along the
tradeoff towards a stronger colonizing ability.

Overall, we find that the model simulates the colonization-
competition tradeoff very well. The model results broadly support
the expected differences in the tradeoff under different settings of

r- and K-selection and disturbance. K-selection shifts the most
abundant
strategy towards a strong competitor with a low
disturbance rate, and towards a better colonizer with a high
disturbance rate. With respect to r-selection, we find a somewhat
different behavior, because the tradeoff is shifted less towards
colonizing ability as hypothesized. This can be attributed to the
way that the model describes establishment. The highest rate of
establishment is achieved in the model by strategies that have high
seed production in addition to a relatively high growth rate,
whereas the number of produced seeds is not explicitly treated in
the model. Nevertheless, the range of the tradeoff is reduced with
r-selection as hypothesized.

Abundances of colonizers, intermediates, and
competitors

The differences in composition in terms of colonizers, interme-
diates, and competitors for the different scenarios of r- and K-
selection and the sensitivity to disturbance rates are shown in
Fig. 6. We find that with neither r- nor K-selection, neither
colonizers nor competitors are favored under different disturbance
rates, because of the lack of r- and K-selection in the model. This
lack of sensitivity is consistent with the tradeoff being essentially
identical under the different disturbance regimes shown in Fig. 5.
With strong r-selection, the abundance of competitors is increased.
This somewhat surprising result is nevertheless consistent with the
reduction and shift of the tradeoff shown in Fig. 5. With strong K-
selection, competitors have a higher abundance under
low
disturbance rates than the case of no r- and K-selection, and
their abundance is reduced with increasing disturbance rates.
Consequently,
the abundance of colonizers is enhanced with
higher disturbance rates. This is, again, consistent with the shift in
abundance that was seen in the tradeoff in Fig. 5. When both r-
and K-selection are included, competitors have the highest
abundance at low disturbance rates, which successively decrease
with greater disturbance rates. This sensitivity is again consistent
with the tradeoff characteristics shown in Fig. 5.

In summary, we find that the simulated sensitivities of the
abundances of competitors and colonizers are consistent with the
hypothesized trends shown in Fig. 1 for the cases of no r- and K-
selection and only K-selection. The results for r-selection deviate
somewhat from the hypothesized trend, because the most favored
strategies under r-selection are not the strategies with the highest

Diversity-disturbance relationships

The resulting shapes of the DDRs for the different scenarios are
shown in Fig. 7. With no r- and K-selection,
the simulated
diversity of the community is insensitive to disturbance rate and
remains at the maximum level of diversity. With increasing r-
selection (Fig. 7a–c), we find a successive decrease in the diversity,
and an increased sensitivity of diversity to high disturbance rates.
In the case of strong r-selection, diversity is reduced at high
disturbance rates, resulting in a decreasing DDR. This is consistent
with the reduced range of the colonization-competition tradeoff
shown in Fig. 5. With increasing strength of K-selection
(Fig. 7a,d,g), we find that the diversity is first relatively unaffected,
but then is reduced at low disturbance rates in the case of strong
K-selection. Hence, this results in an increasing DDR at strong K-
selection. The relative insensitivity of diversity to K-selection is
consistent with the insensitivity of the range of the tradeoff axis
shown in Fig. 5, while the reduction of diversity at low disturbance
rates is consistent with the reduction of the tradeoff axis at strong
K-selection at
low disturbance rates. When both r- and K-
selection, are considered, we note an increasing combination of
the two effects. The maximum diversity reached in the different
scenarios of r- and K-selection strength successively is reduced
with increasing r-selection as is the diversity at high disturbance
rates. Hence, the combination of r- and K-selection results in an
unimodal DDR. This relationship is consistent with the differences
in the tradeoff shown in Fig. 5. The range of the tradeoff with
strong r- and K-selection is reduced at low disturbance rates, and
is broadened in the case of high disturbance rates.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095659.g006

In total, we find that different shapes of the DDRs can be
reproduced with different strengths of r- and K-selection. These
different shapes can clearly be attributed to the effects that r- and
K-selection have on the range of the colonization-competition
tradeoff as represented in the model. This, in turn, is consistent
with the hypotheses that we formulated in the introduction.

Discussion

Limitations

We used two different models, JeDi and DIVE, in our study.
Each model by itself obviously has limitations that affect the results
to some extent. A general discussion of the limitations of the
models can be found in their respective publications [21–23].
Here, we focus on those aspects that directly relate to the testing of
our hypotheses regarding the different shapes of the diversity-
disturbance relationships (DDRs).

The JeDi-DGVM is the basis for our study, as it yields the
potential range of the colonization-competition tradeoff that is
compatible with the prescribed climatic conditions. The tradeoff is
simulated via describing the competitive ability by the biomass,
and the colonizing ability by the growth rate, which is proportional
to biomass, and does not include seed production. This tradeoff is
therefore simulated to be a relatively narrow line (see Fig. 5), which
means that the assimilated carbon is either used for growth or

colonization. However, real plants also use carbon for other
for instance defense and nutrient
processes than just growth,
acquisition. These processes
represent carbon allocation to
different uses than the tradeoff, so that this could result in a
tradeoff that is more spread out than what is being simulated by
the JeDi-DGVM. Given that the JeDi-DGVM can reproduce a
range of observations very well [21,22,25,26], it is reasonable to
assume that this tradeoff, despite probably being too constrained
to a line, is nevertheless reasonably simulated.

This tradeoff represents the key input for the DIVE model,
which, based on the representation of r- and K-selection, simulates
the actual abundances of competitors and colonizers. The DIVE
model was shown to reasonably represent successional dynamics in
ecosystems [23], so that in principle, the effect of r- and K-
selection should be adequately represented. We notice, however,
that the abundances of competitors and colonizers with increasing
disturbance rates (Fig. 6) did not fully follow the trends that we
expected (as shown in Fig. 1). We attribute this to the way that
colonization is represented in the DIVE model as a combination of
seed production and growth rate. In this representation,
the
tradeoff between seed size and seed numbers is not considered.
However, this tradeoff was found to be important [31], because it
partly modulates the colonization-competition tradeoff and leads
to species coexistence (e.g. [32,33]). In our model, plants with a

higher biomass may have a higher seed production than plants
with a smaller biomass, so that the plants with the highest seed
production may not be the ones with the smallest biomass. An
explicit representation of this tradeoff could therefore result in a
sensitivity to the strength of r-selection that would be more
consistent with our hypotheses.

To obtain DDRs, a range of prescribed disturbance rates were
simulated. Disturbances are modeled in a relatively simple way by
a single parameter that influences the mortality equally across all
plant growth strategies [23]. In the real world, disturbances
represent a range of singular events, such as droughts,
fire,
herbivory, and wind throw. Furthermore, several disturbance
types interact (summary in [34]), as well as the intensity and the
frequency of disturbances [35,36]. Despite the simplicity of our
representation, the simulated sensitivities to disturbance rates are
nevertheless plausible and consistent with our hypotheses,
indicating that our representation captures the overall role of
disturbances on the simulated abundances.

Interpretation

Our

results mostly support our hypothesis

that different
strengths of r- and K-selection shape different types of DDRs.
We confirm our hypothesis that a flat relationship is obtained in
the absence of r- and K-selection, because the abundances are
then shaped entirely by the growth and mortality of the different
plant strategies. Diversity decreases with disturbance with strong r-
selection in our results mostly due to a decrease in overall diversity
of the community. With strong K-selection, colonizers are less
excluded at
thus resulting in an
increase of diversity with disturbance. With strong r- and K-
selection, both effects are combined and yield an unimodal DDR.

stronger disturbance rates,

Our interpretation of the role of r- and K-selection for DDRs is
a straightforward and simple extension of the original work on the
IDH [2,3], in which the different strengths by which r- and K-
selection act
from the composition of a
community is being varied. By doing so, different strengths of
the mechanism that results in the IDH is implemented, yielding
different shapes of the DDR.

to exclude species

However, we do not explicitly state the mechanism by which
such a difference in r- and K-selection could take place. One
plausible explanation may be the spatial scale that
is being
considered. Tilman [27] showed that greater coexistence and
diversity in communities is possible with the explicit consideration
of space. Consistent with this interpretation, the neutral model of
Hubbell [20] shows that increasing space leads to greater diversity.
Combined, it would appear that a greater consideration of space
makes the overall composition more neutral, corresponding to a
lower strength of r- and K-selection acting on the composition. In
addition, climate may also alter the strengths of r- and K-selection
as well. These aspects would need to be further evaluated in future
work.

Theoretical ecology offers a variety of hypotheses regarding the
maintenance of biological diversity. Chesson [1] argues that to
achieve coexistence equalizing and stabilizing mechanism are
needed. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexis-
tence, equalizing mechanism are also needed, but alone not
sufficient. Stabilizing mechanism tend to increase negative
intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interac-
tions, such as mortality. Equalizing mechanism minimize fitness
differences between species.

In our study under specific conditions, stable coexistence is
achieved. The existing environmental variations present stabilizing
mechanism, because a variable environment prevents having only

adjusted (via cMORT ), additional
stabilizing mechanisms are
therefore increasingly present
in simulation with a higher
disturbance rate. Equalizing mechanisms in our model are present
through the colonization-competition tradeoff. If a species has a
low competitive ability, then this is compensated by a higher
colonizing ability. Following Chesson, this tradeoff alone is not
able to lead to stable coexistence. This is confirmed in our
simulations. In simulations under strong strength of r- and K-
selection combined with low disturbances coexistence is not
achieved. The high strength of selection makes the advantages of
competitors and colonizers very important for their success. The

coexistence. Decreasing strength of r- or K-selection makes species
more equal, and can also lead to coexistence. In the case of no r-
and no K-selection, the advantages of competitors and colonizers
decrease to zero. This means, that we can interpret the strength of
r- and K-selection as controlling the effectiveness of the equalizing
mechanism.

Our results are largely consistent with Johst and Huth [12].
They used a patch model of successional dynamics and found a
unimodal DDR for most
forest ecosystems under discrete
disturbances. The unimodal DDR was generated through the
successional order from early towards late successional species,
where at intermediate disturbances a mixture of all successional
stage species coexisted. Their results correspond to our scenario
where r- and K-selection are present. Under such conditions we
also observe an unimodal DDR but considering continuous
disturbances. Under some circumstances Johst and Huth [12] also
found a bimodal DDR. In their study, the occurrence of a species
rich intermediate successional group led to a local minimum
between the maxima of mixtures of successional groups. We did
not find such a bimodal relationship, likely because we do not
consider the diversity of successional groups and do not represent
discrete disturbance events.

Our work is only partially consistent with the results of dos
Santos et al. [37]. They used a spatially explicit individual-based
model and showed that
tradeoff mechanisms usually led to
unimodal DDRs, while neutrality led to decreasing DDRs.

Conclusion

We presented a hypothesis that explains different shapes of
diversity-disturbance relationships (DDRs) by different strengths of
competition. The colonization-competition tradeoff plays a key
role in this hypothesis. A plant needs to trade, whether it invests
into its competitive ability and grows tall but slowly (competitor) or
whether it can establish rapidly but grows only small (colonizer).
While r-selection favors colonizers, K-selection favors competitors.
This results in four types of DDRs. A flat DDR is achieved in the
absence of r- and K-selection. Diversity increases with disturbance
under K-selection, and decreases under r-selection. An unimodal
DDR is achieved under both r- and K-selection. We successfully
tested our predictions with a process-based simulation model of
tropical plant communities. Our results are consistent with other
modeling studies on the effects of disturbances for diversity.

Our results show that different intensities of r- and K-selection
have different effects on the range of the colonization-competition
tradeoff, therefore affecting the abundances of colonizers versus
competitors and thus influence community structure and the shape
of the DDR. The strength of r- and K-selection in a community
can thus be expected to be reflected in the combined information
of abundances of colonizers versus competitors, the range of the
colonization-competition tradeoff, the diversity, and possibly the
spatial scale of observation as this may affect the strength of r- and
K-selection. What this implies is that a broader range of field
observations may help us
to better identify the underlying
mechanisms that result in observed diversity patterns.
