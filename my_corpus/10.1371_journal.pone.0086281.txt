Abstract

The Arctic is one of the ecosystems most affected by climate change; in particular, winter temperatures and precipitation
are predicted to increase with consequent changes to snow cover depth and duration. Whether the snow-free period will
be shortened or prolonged depends on the extent and temporal patterns of the temperature and precipitation rise;
resulting changes will likely affect plant growth with cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. We experimentally
manipulated snow regimes using snow fences and shoveling and assessed aboveground size of eight common high arctic
plant species weekly throughout the summer. We demonstrated that plant growth responded to snow regime, and that air
temperature sum during the snow free period was the best predictor for plant size. The majority of our studied species
showed periodic growth; increases in plant size stopped after certain cumulative temperatures were obtained. Plants in
early snow-free treatments without additional spring warming were smaller than controls. Response to deeper snow with
later melt-out varied between species and categorizing responses by growth forms or habitat associations did not reveal
generic trends. We therefore stress the importance of examining responses at the species level, since generalized
predictions of aboveground growth responses to changing snow regimes cannot be made.

Introduction

Snow depth is one of the drivers governing growing season
length in the Arctic [1–4]. It also affects winter soil temperatures
through thermal insulation of soil and vegetation, thus controlling
nutrient turnover rates and availability [5], as well as soil moisture
during the early growing season [3,4]. These are all
factors
influencing plant growth [6], and thus the carbon sink capacity of
arctic ecosystems which are nutrient, moisture, and light (i.e.
snow-free season)
the amount of
available plant biomass and temporal patterns of plant phenology
may have cascading effects on many aspects of the ecosystem, such
as pollinators, herbivores, pathogens, pests [7,11], as well as on the
energy balance of the ecosystem and its albedo.

limited [7–10]. Moreover,

Changes of temperature and precipitation regimes driven by
climatic change will impact arctic and alpine snow cover and are
hence expected to have profound direct (e.g. melt-out date and
temperature sums) and indirect effects (e.g. nitrogen mineraliza-
tion rates) on arctic and alpine ecosystems
[4,5,12]. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes
an increase of winter precipitation and winter temperatures in the
Arctic in its Fourth Assessment Report [13], and these findings are
backed up by their 2013 report (see http://igloo.atmos.uiuc.edu/

IPCC/). However, the magnitude and direction of snow cover
changes are not easily predictable since they strongly depend on
how precipitation sums are distributed across the winter season
and, in particular, the partitioning into snow and rain fractions
[14].

Depending on these factors,

two possible scenarios are
conceivable. (1) Due to rising temperatures in winter, the fraction
of precipitation falling as rain could increase and hence reduce
snow cover depth and duration leading to a longer growing season
[2,4,10–12,15–18]. (2) Temperatures remain low enough during
periods of maximum precipitation to increase winter snow depth
with subsequent later snowmelt, leading to a shortened growing
season [4,19,20]. In recent years, an increase of spring temper-
atures [13,21] and an increasing frequency of extreme rain events
during winter [22] resulted in a general trend towards an earlier
snowmelt
the alternative
scenario remains plausible, too: increasing cloud cover during the
light season could lead to a delay of snowmelt even with reduced
snow depth [4,24]. In addition, climatic forecasts for the Arctic are
usually on a large scale and do not account
for potentially
pronounced regional differences. As an example, the climate of
Svalbard, where this study is situated, differs from many other high
arctic localities by its maritime climate and is influenced by the

gulf stream, resulting in relatively warm winters, cold summers and
strong temperature fluctuations during all seasons [14,25].

Over and above these uncertainties about the future of arctic
snow regimes the likely ecosystem consequences of a changing
snow pack are also variable. Studies in other arctic regions suggest
an increase of net primary production (NPP) following a prolonged
growing season, i.e. after early snowmelt [9,22]. However, Pop
et al. [16] reported that some plant species were unable to increase
or may even decrease their growth in response to an early onset of
the growing season into a thermally less favorable time of the year.
Gamon et al. [8] even reported a general decline of productivity at
his study site. Such an earlier advance could lead to tissue damage
by spring frosts and cold winds after snowmelt, since plants lose
their frost hardiness during the onset of growth. A decrease in
plant growth following delayed snowmelt [27] is assumed to be
due to the constraining effect of a short growing season and
reduced temperature sums on biomass accumulation [4]. Addi-
tionally, a deeper snow pack leads to colder soils after snowmelt
[20,28] but warmer soils during winter [20,29],
leading to a
negative carbon balance for some species (especially ridge plants)
that greatly increase respiration rates during warmer winters [4].
On the other hand, a deeper and prolonged snow cover (a) shelters
plants from spring frosts and cold winds (see above), (b) entails
warmer
in winter, potentially increasing nitrogen (N)
mineralization and thereby improving nutrient availability in
spring [5,18,28,30,31], (c) results in moister soils during the early
growing season [18,20,24,28,32], (d) postpones the onset of plant
growth to a climatically more suitable period [18,33], and (e)
protects plants from exposure to cold winter air in the case of mid-
winter snow melt due to extreme weather events [34,35], all
factors which could potentially alter ecosystem productivity and
plant growth.

soils

In the light of these opposing scenarios and conjectures, generic
predictions of how the future snow pack will affect arctic plant
growth remain difficult. In this study we therefore searched for
potential generic trends by exploring how a delayed and an earlier
melt might affect the aboveground growth of several common high
arctic plant species. To do so, we experimentally manipulated
snow depth and thus melt dates in the field by means of snow
fences
(increasing snow depth, delaying melt) and shoveling
(decreasing snow depth, advancing melt), calculated how these
manipulations changed the cumulative temperature sums received
by the experimental plots, and studied growth responses of target
plants

We hypothesized that 1) melt out date and temperature sums
would affect aboveground plant
size (early melt and high
temperature sum would increase plant size in relation to Normal;
the opposite for late melt), and 2) patterns of response may be
observed at

Materials and Methods

Experimental setup

Fieldwork was conducted in Adventdalen (78u109N, 16u069E),
Svalbard, Norway, throughout summer 2011, from 1 May until 12
September. Annual mean air
temperature during 2002–11
(Longyearbyen airport) was 23.7uC, and average temperatures
of the coldest month (March), the warmest month (July) and
annual mean precipitation were 213.5uC, 7.2uC and 177 mm,
respectively [41]. The mean air temperature during June, July and
August (JJA) during 2002–11 was 5.8uC and 6.3uC during 2011.

High Arctic Plants Respond to Changing Snow Regime

The study year can thus be considered an average year in that five
of the 10 preceding years had average JJA temperatures close to
6.3uC. Similar considerations hold for accumulative temperature
sums (thawing degree days, TDD) and accumulative precipitation
during the same period (see Table S1 for details). During 2008 to
2012, our group reported winter warming events in 2010 and
2012 [35], resulting in snow removal and subsequent extreme low
soil temperature spikes during mid-cold-season which interfered
with flower abundances of some species. No such warming event
or similar spiking of soil temperature occurred during the winter
preceding the present study, so we thus exclude the possibility of
frost damage of our study species during the cold-season 2010–
2011. Air temperatures after melt-out remained positive through-
out the growing-season in all snow regimes, i.e. no growing-season
freezing events were observed in 2011.

for heterogeneity of

from each other to account

The experimental setup is based on Morgner et al. [20]. We
used nine of the twelve existing snow fences (1.5 m tall and 6.2 m
long) which were established in autumn 2006, distributed over an
area of approximately 1.5 km62.5 km and grouped into blocks of
three fences (each 2006200 m) that were erected at least 500 m
apart
the
landscape. The fences were established perpendicular to the main
winter wind direction, such that snow transported by wind
accumulated behind the fences (leeside) due to turbulences. Behind
each fence, two subplots of 75675 cm were selected: one in the
area of the deepest snow (approx. 150 cm, thereafter called Deep),
and another one in the area of intermediate snow depth (60–
100 cm, thereafter called Medium), both representing a climate
scenario that predicts a moderate to pronounced delay of
snowmelt and hence a shortened growing season. To account
for a climate scenario that predicts less snow in favor of rain and
hence an earlier melt-out we designated a subplot next to each
fence on a small windblown ridge that melted out naturally earlier
than average (snow depth: 1–5 cm, in the following named Shallow)
and another one on which the snow was manually removed on 1
May (snow depth 10–35 cm, in the following named Removed). In
contrast to the other snow regimes, Removed subplots were newly
established in autumn 2010. We compared these regimes with
current conditions in an unmodified Normal subplot for each fence,
in an area representative for most of the valley’s snow depth,
approx. 10–35 cm. The average melt-out dates during 2008–2012
were 24 May in Shallow, 2 June in Normal, 12 June in Medium, 19
June in Deep [35]. Since not all treatments (i.e. snow regimes) could
be realized at each fence the experiment was based on a total of 37
subplots: four Removed, eight Shallow, nine Normal, seven Medium
and nine Deep. The low number of Removed subplots is due to
marker stick removal by reindeer during wintertime.

The land on which the field site is situated belongs to Store
Norske Spitsbergen Grubekompani [42] and the fieldwork permit
for this study was obtained from this company, the Governor of
Svalbard [43] (reference number 2006/00803-3a.521) and the
Longyearbyen Lokalstyre [44] (reference number 2009/401-2)
and no protected species were sampled.

Abiotic measurements

Before snowmelt, all subplots were observed every second day
and were defined as snow free when 50% of their area had melted
out. In each block (i.e. set of three fences) one data logger was
installed (Tiny Tag Plus 2, Gemini Data Loggers, UK) which
recorded soil temperatures hourly at approximately two centime-
ters below the soil surface from 4 September 2007 in Normal and
Deep, and from 1 June 2010 in Removed, Shallow, and Medium. Daily
average soil temperatures of each logger were used for the entire
block. Daily average air temperatures at two meters above the

ground were taken from the new weather station of the University
Centre in Svalbard in Adventdalen [45] around six kilometers west
of the study site in the same valley. Soil moisture of thawed soil was
measured weekly using a hand held Theta probe ML2X (delta-T
devices, Cambridge, UK) 4–5 times at each of at six subplots per
snow regime, spanning the site to account for the vegetative and
geographic heterogeneity.

From the temperature measurements we calculated nine
different temperature variables for each subplot, three from air
and six from soil measurements (Table 1): these variables represent
either the number of days with a mean temperature above 0uC or
the cumulative temperature sums above this threshold (thawing
degree days, TDD) since either melt-out dates or 1. May, i.e. the
date on which the snow was shoveled away on Removed subplots. In
addition, we also calculated the number of days with a mean
temperature above 5uC. TDD and number of days until the day of
each growth measurement were then matched with the recorded
plant size.

Biotic measurements

All biotic measurements were based on the ITEX manual [40]
and were carried out from 13 June until 8 September 2011 at
weekly intervals. For those study species not mentioned in the
ITEX manual we adapted protocols following those of similar
species or growth forms. We chose eight of the most common
species of the study site as target species, including deciduous and
evergreen shrubs, graminoids and perennial
forbs, as well as
snowbed and ridge species: Alopecurus magellanicus, Bistorta vivipara
(syn. Polygonum viviparum), Cassiope tetragona, Dryas octopetala, Luzula
arcuata subsp. confusa, Pedicularis hirsuta, Salix polaris and Stellaria
crassipes
(Table 2; nomenclature according to The Flora of
Svalbard [46]).

As soon as a subplot had melted out, or individuals of a given
species were visible, one randomly chosen individual or ramet per
species was selected. For Salix four individuals per subplot were
chosen intending to include a female and a male specimen in the
study. Plant size was measured with an electronic caliper with an
accuracy of 0.1 mm. Only green parts (assumed to be photosyn-
thetically active) were measured. If the marked individual got lost
due to grazing or wind removal of the marker, a new randomly
chosen individual or ramet nearby was marked and observed from
then on and treated as a replicate in order to avoid loss of data.

temperature variables (temperature sums) based on daily
average temperatures.

the recorded individuals or ramets were followed

For each species different measurements were taken according
to their morphology (Table 2). For Alopecurus, Dryas, Luzula and
Salix the summed length of all leaves per shoot (in mm) excluding
the petiole or ligule (where applicable) was used. For Bistorta the
length and width of each leaf was used to calculate the leaf areas as
ellipses and single leaf values were then summed for each
individual. For Pedicularis and Stellaria, plant length/height was
measured from soil surface until the uppermost leaf. For Cassiope,
the growth increment of a shoot of the year was used since the
insertion of the youngest leaf on the caulis was not easily visible.

Statistical analyses

the nine different

Since the data was collected in a hierarchically organized
experimental set up, we used linear mixed-effects models for
analysis. We assumed a unimodal relationship between time and
plant
size since plants usually do not grow cumulatively
throughout the vegetation period but with a peak during early
to mid-season, followed by a decline of live plant tissue due to
senescence and leaf drop. In the analysis, we hence fitted a second
order polynomial of each of
temperature
variables to the size measurements (Table 1) of each species
separately, with random effects for fence area, fence (i.e. plot),
subplot and individual. We selected the best among the nine
temperature models per species based on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), and the one with the lowest AIC was chosen. We
then sequentially removed each term of the selected full model and
compared which of the reduced models was the best fitting one
(i.e. with the lowest AIC) and then used that
to predict
temperature sum needed until
(and magnitude of) maximum
plant size for each species and snow regime by determining the
peaks of the hump-shaped functions.

(2)

Treatment effects on (1) melt-out dates,

the different
temperature variables, and (3) the average size of the species
throughout the season were also evaluated by means of mixed
effects models with the same group structure as defined above.
Potential heteroscedasticity was considered for as much grouping
levels as possible (i.e. parameter estimation algorithms converted).
With respect to plant size, these analyses were conducted for every
species separately as well as for all species together to test for
generic trends. In the latter case, we scaled all species-specific size
measurement to a common range between 0 and 1 and added
growth form and habitat association as predictor variables, as well
as species identity as an additional (highest) group variable. Each
model was then sequentially reduced and the one with the lowest
AIC selected. All analyses were conducted with R [47] using the
packages nlme [48] and lattice [49].

Melt-out dates of the Normal regime differed significantly from
all other snow regimes (Table 3). Snow was manually Removed on 1
May, Shallow regime was snow free on 30 May, Normal on 4 June,
Medium on 12 June, Deep on 16 June; thus the onset of the snow
free period varied by up to 46 days between regimes. Soil moisture
was high (55–70%) immediately following snowmelt, and dropped
throughout the growing season (to 30–50% at end August). Soils in
Deep and Medium were moister- and those in Shallow were drier-
than Normal
led to a
pooling of water in the subplot Removed due to an influx of melting
water from surrounding areas (personal observation), and this gave
rise to higher soil moisture during the growing season than in the
Normal or Shallow regimes (Figure S1).

Thawing degree days of air temperatures since melt-out (TDD)
was the temperature variable that explained plant size for all
species best, due to its lowest AIC. For Dryas octopetala only the
TDD of air since 1 May was a better fitting variable, but TDD
since melt-out was still a highly significant predictor for this
species’ size (AIC difference: 6). For consistency, we have therefore
used TDD since melt-out in all subsequent analyses of all species.
The TDD after melt-out of individual subplots depends on melt-
out dates only, since air temperatures were derived from one single
weather station. Consequently,
this variable differed between
treatments in parallel to melt-out dates although the difference
between Normal and Shallow subplots was not statistically significant
(Table 3), most probably because of low air temperatures in spring.
However, no other variable calculated from our temperature
measurement series was able to explain temporal plant growth
patterns in a similarly consistent way across species.

Growth pattern

All species. Only Shallow had an effect on the aboveground
growth when regarding all species together and led to decreased
plant sizes (Table 4). Both growth form and habitat association did
not remain in the model after model selection and comparison of
AIC, hence there were no generic aboveground growth patterns
detectable - of the different growth forms or habitat associations-
resulting from variable TDD or melt-out dates.

Species-specific overview. The species-specific results are
summarized in Table 5. The Deep regime led to decreased growth
of Cassiope and Salix but increased of Bistorta and Dryas. Medium led

Alopecurus magellanicus. The summed leaf

lengths of
Alopecurus were only significantly higher in Medium than in Normal
plots, namely by 50% (Table 6). In all treatments similar amounts
of TDD were required to reach peak sizes and range between
322uC (Removed) and 363uC (Medium; Figure 1a).

Bistorta vivipara. The sum of Bistorta leaf area increased
significantly behind fences, by 95% and 66% in Deep and Medium,
respectively (Table 6, Figure 1b). Individuals in Deep reached their
full size later, i.e. at higher levels of TDD, and they preserved their
time. In regimes
maximum biomass for a longer period of
becoming snow-free earlier than Normal,
the size of Bistorta
individuals did not significantly differ from those of Normal;
maximal plant sizes also required about the same temperature
sums.

treatments

Cassiope tetragona. All

lowered the shoot
increment of Cassiope compared to Normal (Table 6, Figure 1c).
Most individuals in Medium and Shallow subplots did not grow at all
throughout the season, so reduced the shoot increment to 82%
and 92% of Normal, respectively. In the Deep and Removed regimes,
shoots of Cassiope grew to only 36% and 59% of Normal lengths,
and the modeled maximum plant sizes were only 57% and 61% of
those of Normal, respectively.
Dryas octopetala. All

from Shallow in-
creased leaf lengths and peak sizes for Dryas in comparison to
Normal
(Table 6). Treatment effects were most pronounced in
Medium where plants grew 60% larger than Normal, and the
estimated maximum plant size was almost 75% larger, followed by
Deep (38% increase in total leaf length, 53% larger peak sizes),
where the species grew fastest after snowmelt (Figure 1d). In the
Removed treatment, a leaf length increase of 28% was recorded
compared to Normal.

treatments apart

Luzula arcuata. Growth responses of Luzula to differing
snow regimes were rather inconsistent (Table 6, Figure 1e). In
Removed, average plant size was significantly increased by 27%
compared to Normal, whereas Shallow significantly reduced the
species’ growth by almost the same extent (24%). In parallel, plants
reached a 12% higher maximum leaf length in Removed, but a 35%
lower maximum in Shallow regime. Shortening the growing season
did not affect the species’ full-season leaf length significantly.

Pedicularis hirsute. Earlier as well as later snowmelt had a
negative effect on the average plant size of Pedicularis. However, no
significant effect was found in Deep, maybe because of scarcity of
data for this treatment (Table 6). The full-season plant size was
decreased by 15% in Removed, 42% in Shallow and 19% in Medium.

High Arctic Plants Respond to Changing Snow Regime

The individuals in Removed regime had a peculiar temporal growth
pattern: they grew rapidly in the beginning and then their size
hardly changed throughout the rest of the season, whereas plants
in other snow regimes grew more steadily (Figure 1f).

Salix Polaris. Only a very late snowmelt (Deep regime) had a
significantly negative effect on the average total length of Salix
leaves and reduced it by 11% compared to Normal conditions (31%
in terms of maximum length; Table 6). In the Medium treatment
leaves were smaller than in Normal during their early growth
phases, but an accelerated growth later in the season compensated
for this disadvantage (Figure 1g). Peak sizes were hence similar to
those of Normal individuals, but plants required higher TDD sums
to reach their maximum size (329.4 in Medium, compared to 281.3
in Normal). Earlier snowmelt (Removed and Shallow regimes) did not
affect the leaf length significantly.

Stellaria crassipes. The average length of Stellaria decreased
with a delayed and increased with an advanced snowmelt,
although this trend was only significant
for the intermediate
regimes - with a decrease of 49% (3.5 mm) in Medium and an
increase of 64% (11.3 mm) in Shallow compared to Normal (Table 6,
Figure 1h). Furthermore, the modeled maximal sizes and TDD to
reach this size suggest that individuals in Removed and Medium grew
until the end of the season, but not those in Normal and Shallow.
However, these trends are based on scarce data and we hence
consider the regression and maximal plant sizes of individuals in
Deep as unreliable.

Discussion

Cumulative air temperature (TDD) since snowmelt was found
to be the best predictor of aboveground plant size. Surprisingly,
the cumulative soil temperatures at our site did not describe the
plant size as well as the air temperatures 6 km away, and from our
data it is not possible to tease out whether this is due to insufficient
geographical resolution of microclimatic thermal variation [61] or
whether it is the air temperature driving plant growth. This could
be tested by installing air and soil temperature loggers at each
subplot, which we did not do here. Our findings, however, do
indicate that the use of data from nearby climate stations may be
useful
for up-scaling into areas without detailed plot-level
temperature data.

Generalizations regarding aboveground growth responses of all
vascular plants to changes in the snow regimes studied are hard to
make. Responses were species-specific and not grouped to growth
forms or habitat associations (snow bed vs. ridge species). Analysis
of data across all eight species indicated just one trend; lower
aboveground plant size on ridges (i.e. Shallow snow regime).
However, even this response was not common to all species, but
driven by a relatively strong effect of Shallow on some of them. The
detected species-specific variation of aboveground growth respons-
es to different snow regimes is probably a consequence of niche
specializations of each individual species. Chapin and Shaver [36]
concluded that growth of different species is limited by species-
specific adaptations and competition, probably leading to observed
individualistic responses to environmental manipulations which
could not be explained by growth form, as was also the case in our
study. No single environmental factor seems to be able to explain
growth limitations of a whole community.

Only some of our species followed the hypothesized response,
i.e. an earlier growing season start and higher temperature sum
increased plant
size, and later melt/lower temperature sum
reduced plant size, compared to Normal snow regime. However,
the responses to deeper snow/later melt might be driven by factors
other than growing season length: e.g. deeper snow leads to

and negative alterations to the abiotic environment in terms of the

differences in growing season and winter temperature demands,
nutrient and water requirements do not strictly parallel simulta-
neous changes in these conditions and resource supply rates result
in varied response patterns [36]. For instance, plants that grew
better following enhanced winter snow depth might have partly
responded to increased nutrient supply [5,37,50,51]. Indeed, in
the same experiment our group observed a threefold increase of

under deep snow [29]. Soil moisture was enhanced in deeper snow
treatments, especially during the first part of the growing season

season [29] (see also Figure S1). Moisture limited species might
therefore benefit
from deepened snow particularly in the
beginning of the season, in the period of fastest growth.

trade-off

for nutrient-,

An intermediate increase of snow cover in Medium can thus lead
to a beneficial
season length- and
temperature limited high arctic vegetation [10,18,24,39,52] and
enable greater growth by providing enhanced moisture and
nutrient availability [29] with a season length maintained above a
critical threshold. This was most likely the case for Alopecurus
magellanicus, Bistorta vivipara and Dryas octopetala in our study. A
positive growth response to controlled nutrient addition in Ny-
A˚ lesund, Svalbard, was also reported for B. vivipara [50,53] and D.
octopetala [51] (although not in Robinson et al. [53] in the same
study). In contrast, we detected a negative effect of a moderately
increased snow pack on the growth of Cassiope tetragona, Pedicularis
hirsuta and Stellaria crassipes, which was what we expected when only
taking season length into account. These species were probably
not able to benefit enough from improved nutrient/soil moisture
supply [29] and were negatively affected by the delayed snowmelt.
Schimel et al. [5] suggested that species with dynamic root systems
might be able to benefit from a nutrient flush in spring caused by
deep winter snow before N immobilization occurs shortly after.
However, as a semi-parasite and cryptophyte, Pedicularis might
have slow growing roots, and the same could hold for the slow
growing dwarf shrub Cassiope. That could explain both species’
inability to benefit from snow fence induced nutrient flushes [29],
and their negative response to the later snowmelt and shortened
growing season. Additionally, as shown by Havstro¨m et al. [54]
Cassiope did not respond to fertilizer addition but to summer
temperatures in relatively cold Svalbard with opposite responses in
the warmer sub-arctic lowlands of Abisko, Sweden. They thereby
suggest a co-limitation of temperature and nutrient availability for
that species, where growing temperature demands have to be
fulfilled before enhanced nutrients can be utilized.

The highly variable, species-specific responses of arctic plants to
changes in snow pack are a generic finding, which holds even if
our experimental manipulations have some associated caveats.
Indeed, the experimental treatments resulted in specific combina-
tions of growing season length, microclimate during (early) growth
and nutrient and water [29]. These conditions are unlikely to
become fully realized under natural conditions following climate
change, mainly because some treatments had artificial side effects
that were only due to our manipulations. This is particularly true
for the Removed treatment, which may have gained additional

nutrients washed in with the extra melt water from surrounding
areas, which might, together with extra moisture, have contributed
to the enhanced growth of Dryas and Luzula. Second, climate
change may also ameliorate early season climatic conditions [7],
which might enhance the potential beneficial effect of an earlier
melting date. In contrast to the assumption for arctic ecosystems
[12,26] a naturally earlier snowmelt and thus a longer growing
season (Shallow) only resulted in an increased biomass for Stellaria -
in terms of average but for not for peak plant sizes. Cassiope, Luzula
and Pedicularis even had lower average and peak sizes in Shallow
compared to Normal. We assume that these results are due to a shift
of the onset of growth and thus of the determination of leaf set
towards climatic conditions which are cooler than expected under
a future warmer climate [18,33,55] and a more likely exposure of
dehardened plant tissue to spring frosts and cold winds [11,16,55],
as well as reduced thermal insulation during winter. On the other
hand, the Shallow snow cover at these sites might be representative
for future average conditions and expose aboveground tissues to
fluctuating air temperatures causing dehardening during winter
warm spells, followed by exposure to cold winter temperatures.
This potentially harms overwintering meristems and reduces
growth in the following season, as has been observed in Vaccinium
myrtillus in the sub-Arctic during winters with low snow cover
[56,57]. Under these conditions, growth as observed in Normal
snow regime might only occur during growing seasons following
exceptionally stable winters without dehardening periods. In
addition, recent research has demonstrated that in contrast to
aboveground growth, sexual reproduction of alpine and arctic
plants may suffer severely even from episodic mild frost events
during anthesis [58] which will likely still occur under warmer
average spring temperatures. At least in the longer term many
plants are hence at risk from shallower snow and earlier melt-out.
While our hypothesis 2 was rejected regarding the uniformity of
species in their growth response to an earlier or later snowmelt, we
could accept hypothesis 1 as cumulative temperature sums since
the date of snow melt were indeed found to be a highly significant
predictor of the size of arctic plants. In fact the critical role of
temperature sums for plant life in cold-limited climates is not too
surprising [37,50,59]. As a consequence, the size of the plants
depended less on the length of the season but more on the overall
input of warmth during the snow-free period. For instance, a
shortened growing season could be compensated by higher air
temperatures and vice versa. This suggests that the response of
plants in the future to altered snow pack characteristics will
strongly depend on the climatic conditions following melt-out.

Grouping species into plant functional types (PFTs) according to
their physiology rather than growth form might simplify the
analyses of community responses to environmental perturbations
[38], such as grouping to 1) periodic species with a genetically
fixed growing period, and 2) aperiodic species with a growing
(e.g. Bistorta [7]) as
period constrained by external
summarized by Wookey et al. [60]. In the case of Cassiope and
Pedicularis the majority of individuals steadily grew until the end of
season under most
irrespective of accumulated
temperature. These two species could therefore be categorized

as aperiodic functional types, which grow until environmental
conditions become unfavorable. However, all other observed
species (Alopecurus, Bistorta, Dryas, Luzula, Salix and Stellaria) stopped
growing after a given temperature sum. These could therefore be
categorized as periodic species with growth limited by internal
factors. This also suggests that these species are unlikely to benefit
greatly from an earlier or warmer spring and longer potential
growing season, and that is likely to have knock-on effects for
grazing herbivores relying on these plants as forage. However, we
emphasize that we only measured one aspect of growth, while little
is known about the dynamics of belowground or stem growth,
which might well continue until after leaf growth ceased.

Conclusions

We demonstrated that air temperature sums since melt-out best
explained aboveground growth for all species in most snow
regimes. We conclude that the response of high arctic plants to
climate-driven changes in snow regimes is highly species-specific,
and thus it is very important to study several common high arctic
species instead of only one. Some species were very responsive (e.g.
Bistorta vivipara), others were highly resistant (e.g. Salix polaris); still
others seemed to respond negatively to any changes (e.g. Cassiope
tetragona), and this may explain their occurrence in the landscape.
Certain species (Luzula arcuata, Salix polaris) were unaffected by a
moderate increase in snow depth. In contrast, a deep snow pack
reduced the growth of certain species (Cassiope tetragona, Salix
polaris), most likely due to reducing the growing season length to
under a threshold level; yet this regime increased the growth of
other species (Bistorta vivipara, Dryas octopetala), possibly due to 1)
increased soil moisture in early summer and 2) enhanced
mineralization rates during winter resulting in increased nutrient
availability during summer [29]. In the Shallow snow regime that
melted five days earlier than Normal, all plants (except Stellaria
crassipes) were smaller, possibly as a result of decreased protection
from cold winter air temperatures or start of growth early in the
spring time whilst temperatures were still cold. The Removed regime
enhanced the growth of Luzula arcuata and Dryas octopetala in
contrast
indicating that
enhanced moisture and possibly in-washed nutrients (due to the
influx of melt water from surrounding areas) were contributing
factors.

to their response to shallow snow,

size increases

Many of our studied species showed a periodic growth pattern,
i.e. plant
stopped after a certain cumulative
temperature was obtained. This is important especially regarding
forage availability for herbivores as it indicates that a warmer
growing season may simply lead to an earlier peak instead of an
increase in biomass. A spatially patchy environment in summer
would enable a range of phenological stages and plant sizes to be
available for foragers, instead of all plants reaching their peak size
simultaneously. In this way, it would spread the occurrence of peak

plant size over a longer duration in the summer. By contrast,
removal of late lying snow-beds would diminish this patchiness in
the foraging environment, which may be to the herbivores’
disadvantage.

We point out that this study presents an imperfect simulation of
future conditions as it does not account or control for (1) realistic
changes in temperature, especially during spring time, and (2) the
confounding effects of altered moisture and nutrient supplies. Thus
we recommend future studies to investigate these issues in more
detail, for example by arranging snow fence experiments along
ambient temperature gradients and measure nutrient and moisture
supply rates as covariates. Nevertheless, climate change and its
consequences
for arctic snow regimes will certainly affect
temperature conditions during the growing season and winter as
well as nutrient and moisture supply simultaneously. The plant
species studied responded differently to the various snow regimes,
indicating that a changing climate is likely to result in a shift in
species composition. Indirectly, such a shift in species composition
will probably affect community, and finally ecosystem productiv-
ity.
