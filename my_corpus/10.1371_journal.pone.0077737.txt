Abstract

Sediments are widely accepted as a threat to coral reefs but our understanding of their ecological impacts is limited.
Evidence  has  suggested  that  benthic  sediments  bound  within  the  epilithic  algal  matrix  (EAM)  suppress  reef  fish
herbivory, a key ecological process maintaining reef resilience. An experimental combination of caging and sediment
addition treatments were used to investigate the effects of sediment pulses on herbivory and EAMs and to determine
whether  sediment  addition  could  trigger  a  positive-feedback  loop,  leading  to  deep,  sediment-rich  turfs.  A  1-week
pulsed  sediment  addition  resulted  in  rapid  increases  in  algal  turf  length  with  effects  comparable  to  those  seen  in
herbivore  exclusion  cages.  Contrary  to  the  hypothesised  positive-feedback  mechanism,  benthic  sediment  loads
returned to natural levels within 3 weeks, however, the EAM turfs remained almost 60% longer for at least 3 months.
While reduced herbivore density is widely understood to be a major threat to reefs, we show that acute disturbances
to  reef  sediments  elicit  similar  ecological  responses  in  the  EAM.  With  reefs  increasingly  threatened  by  both
reductions  in  herbivore  biomass  and  altered  sediment  fluxes,  the  development  of  longer  turfs  may  become  more
common on coral reefs.

Introduction

Coral  reefs  are  among  the  most  biodiverse  ecosystems  on
the  planet.  Despite  the  ecological  and  physical  complexity
associated  with  this  biodiversity,  they  are  remarkably  fragile.
The  increasing  rate  of  disturbances  associated  with  climate
change  and  other  anthropogenically  induced  stressors  has
repeatedly  highlighted  that  acute  stressors  can  have  long
lasting  impacts  [1,2].  For  example,  temperature  anomalies
lasting  for  very  short  periods  can  result  in  bleaching  events,
which  have  long-term  effects  at  reef-wide  scales  [3].  While
temperature anomalies might be the best understood, there are
many other acute threats to coral reefs. These include storms,
freshwater inundation and, potentially, sediments.

The  source  of  sediment  on  coral  reefs  affects  its  physical
and chemical properties. Fine marine (primarily carbonate) and
terrigenous  (primarily  silicate)  sediments  can  be  transported
long  distances  in  suspension  and/or  driven  by  hydrodynamic
activity 
these  sediments  can  be  particularly
deleterious to coral reefs, blocking light penetration and, upon
settling, producing blankets of smothering silt [5], their affects

[4].  While 

tend  to  be  best-documented  on  near-shore  reefs  [6].  The
proximity to the sources of terrigenous sediments and shallow
waters  allow  sediments  to  be  effectively  resuspended  and
transported  to  these  reefs  [4].  On  reefs  further  from  shore,
however, most sediment is produced in situ as the reef matrix
is eroded into sediments by physical, biological and, chemical
processes [7].

While  benthic  sediments  are  highly  dynamic  on  offshore
coral reefs [8,9]. The continual production of sediments through
erosion is often balanced by hydrodynamically driven losses to
deep  water  or  accretion  into  cays  or  beaches  [8].  As  such,
although  the  sediment  is  constantly  moving,  the  system
remains in a state of dynamic stability [10,11], with all but the
most severe perturbations being short lived [12].

On  hard  coral  reef  substrata  some  sediment  exists  in  sand
patches,  but  a  large  proportion  of  the  benthic  sediment  is
bound within algal turfs [13–16]. The turfs also trap detritus and
provide habitat for infaunal organisms [17,18]. Together, these
components  form  an  epilithic  algal  matrix  (EAM;  [19]);  a
ubiquitous feature of coral reefs, often occupying more benthic
space  than  corals  [16,20].  On  the  Great  Barrier  Reef,  EAMs

cover  between  18  and  59%  of  the  reef  surface  [21].  While
EAMs  can  play  positive  roles  on  coral  reefs,  with  some
components  providing  settlement  cues  for  corals  [22]  and
others  directly  adding  to  carbonate  accretion  [23],  they  also
have  several  deleterious  impacts.  Algae  within  the  EAMs  can
compete  with  corals  for  space  [24,25],  increase  sediment
deposition  [26,27]  and  reduce  the  settlement  success  and
survivorship of juvenile corals [28,29]. The algal turfs in EAMs
can  also  represent  an  early  stage  in  successional  growth  of
macroalgae on reefs [30,31].

trapped 

On  ‘healthy’  coral  reefs,  EAMs  are  maintained  as  well-
cropped productive turfs by herbivores, usually reef fishes [32].
The intensity of herbivory by fishes on these reefs can control
the  growth  of  algae  [33–35].  While  herbivory  is  clearly  a  vital
function  on  coral  reefs,  recent  evidence  suggests 
that
sediments  may  affect  reef  fish  communities  [36,37],  and
furthermore,  sediments 
the  EAM  can  deter
herbivores from feeding [10,11]. Sediment reductions result in
almost  instantaneous  increases  in  rates  of  reef  fish  herbivory
and  measurable  declines  in  algal  turf  length  in  less  than  four
hours  [10].  The  increased  herbivory  with  reduced  sediment
loads 
trapped  sediments  actively  deter
herbivores,  however,  evidence  for  sediment  suppression  of
herbivory remains almost entirely based on sediment removal
experiments,  which  report 
following
sediment  reductions  [10,11].  Yet  questions  remain:  a)  will  an
increase  in  sediments  produce  similar  changes  in  herbivory?
And  b)  are  these  effects  long-lasting  or  temporary?  This  is
particularly interesting as increased sediments are believed to
pose an ongoing threat to coral reefs [5,38].

increasing  herbivory 

indicates 

that 

The  interactions  between  benthic  sediment  and  herbivory
suggest  the  possibility  of  a  positive  feedback  loop.  Any
disturbance leading to increased EAM sediment load, such as
exposure  to  a  sediment  plume  from  storms,  flooding  or
dredging  could  deter  herbivores.  The  reduced  top  down
pressure on the EAM is likely to result in an increase in EAM
length  [10],  allowing  further  sediment  trapping  [27,35].  The
potential  result  is  a  self-sustaining,  long,  sediment-rich  EAM,
unpalatable  to  herbivores.  Using  a  combination  of  herbivore
exclusion cages and pulsed sediment additions we attempt to
initiate this positive feedback and generate a deep, sediment-
rich  EAM.  In  doing  so,  we  will  provide  information  on  the
relative impacts of sediment pulses and herbivore removal on
coral reef resilience.

Experimental procedures

Experimental manipulations were conducted at two sites on
the  exposed  reef  crest  southeast  of  Lizard  Island  in  the

Sediment on High-Energy Coral Reefs

northern  section  of  the  Great  Barrier  Reef,  Australia.  The
experiment was conducted between December and March, in
the  southern  hemisphere  summer.  The  sites  had  similar
topographies, were at a depth of 2-4 m, and separated by over
800  m.  Sites  were  characterised  by  sparse  coral  colonies,
separated by expanses of short well-cropped EAMs on a flat,
low-complexity  reef  matrix.  At  each  site,  six  fully  caged,  six
open  (uncaged)  and  six  partially  caged  1  m2  plots  were
haphazardly  delineated  on  the  flat  EAM.  Full  cages  were
constructed of a steel bar frame, 25 cm high, enclosing the 1
m2  plot,  attached  to  the  reef  using  epoxy  putty  and  enclosed
with  galvanised  4  cm  wire  mesh.  Partial  cages  were
constructed of vertical panels identical to those used in the fully
caged treatments and were deployed to control for any effect of
the  cage  treatments  on  the  EAM  or  sediment,  while  allowing
herbivores access to graze the EAM.

leeward  of 

Half of the plots in each cage treatment were subjected to an
experimental  sediment  addition.  In  these  addition  plots,  a
sediment load of 8.6 kg m-2 was maintained for one week. This
sediment load was equivalent to that on the adjacent reef flat
(approximately  40  m 
the  crest),  which  was
determined  by  weighing  dried  sediment  samples  collected
using an electric vacuum sampler from 20 replicate 5.8 × 10-3
m2 rings (see [39]). The sediment for treatments was collected
from a reef-margin sand apron and had a similar particle size
profile to that found on the reef flat. When evenly spread, the
8.6 kg of sediment covered the 1 m2 plot to a depth of 15 mm.
Sediment was added daily to each plot to maintain this depth
for  one  week,  simulating  an  acute  sedimentation  event.  Then
the plots were left undisturbed for the remainder of the three-
month experimental period.

The sediment depth and EAM turf length in each plot were
recorded using the depth probe of vernier calipers (n = 20 reps
for  each  plot).  Measurements  were  made  as  sediment  was
initially manipulated (T0), then at weekly intervals for 6 weeks
post-manipulation (T1-6), and again after three months (T7).

EAM turf length data were standardised to percent increase
over  initial  turf  length  (at  T0)  correcting  for  initial  variation
among plots. The data were then analysed using 2- and 3-way
analyses  of  variances  (ANOVAs)  of  the  T7  data.  Site  was
categorised  as  a  random  factor  and  was  found  to  have  no
significant  effect  or  interaction.  It  was  therefore  pooled  to
increase the power of the analysis [40,41]. Data normality was
assessed using residuals plots and square-root transformations
were  applied  where  necessary.  To  allow  data  transformation
for statistical analyses, negative percent EAM turf length values
were  removed  by  the  addition  of  a  constant  to  all  data.  Time
series  data  were  analysed  using  2-  and  3-way  repeated
measures  ANOVAs  (RM  ANOVAs).  Multivariate  comparisons
(Pillai’s  Trace;  RM  MANOVAs)  were  used  if  assumptions  of
sphericity were violated.

Results

After three months (T7) the greatest increase in the length of
algae in the EAM was seen in the caged plots and a significant
difference in turf length was observed between the caged and
open  plots

Sediment  additions  to  the  open  plots,  however,  resulted  in
remarkable EAM turf algae growth, i.e., over 435% greater than
observed on open, natural sediment treatment plots (Figure 2).
The time series data showed an initial rapid increase in turf
length followed by an apparent asymptote after approximately
three  weeks  (Figure  3).  Data  differed  significantly  over  time
(RM MANOVA; Pillai’s Trace = 0.647, F6,25 = 7.639, P <0.0001)
and  in  the  time  ×  caging  interaction  (Pillai’s  Trace  =  0.636,
F12,52 = 2.022, P = 0.041). No other factors showed significant
interactions (Table S3).

Direct  measurements  of  the  sediment  loads  in  the  EAMs
were  conducted  alongside  measurements  of  the  EAM  turf
length.  Unlike  the  turf  length,  sediment  rapidly  declined  in  all
treatments  to  levels  indistinguishable  from  natural  sediment
loads within three weeks (Figure 4; Table S4).

Discussion

We found that a one-week pulsed increase in sediment loads
resulted in significant and sustained (3-month) increases in the
length of turfs in EAMs on a coral reef (Figure 1). However, our
results  provide  only  limited  support  for  the  existence  of  the
proposed  positive  feedback  loop.  Although  the  length  of  turfs
increased,  high  hydrodynamic  activity  on  the  crest  (e.g.  [42])
quickly  removed  sediment  from  the  turfs  and  the  predicted
deep, sediment-rich turfs were not formed. Increased EAM turf
length did not appear to require high sediment loads.

The  EAMs  on  the  exposed  crest  used  in  this  study  are
heavily  grazed  by  coral  reef  fishes,  which  maintain  short,
productive algal turfs [43]. Previous studies have demonstrated
that  when  EAM  with  long  turfs  are  transplanted  from  the  reef
flat  (low  herbivore  pressure)  to  the  crest  (high  herbivore
pressure) they are rapidly consumed by fishes [13,35]. It was,

transformed  data:  F2,24  =  7.32,  P  =  0.003).  While  no  other
factors  or  interactions  were  significant  (Table  S2),  a  Fisher’s
least  significant  difference  (LSD)  post-hoc  test  revealed  two
groupings  in  the  caging  ×  sediment  treatment  interaction
(Figure  2).  Without  sediments,  a  clear  cage  effect  was
observed. Algal length increased by 58.9%; no response was
seen in the open or partial cages.

Sediment  additions  to  caged  and  partially  caged  plots
resulted  in  no  observable  differences  to  the  EAM  when

releasing the algae from any sediment-induced suppression of
herbivory (e.g. [10,11]). This was not the case.

The EAMs in the present study grew in response to reduced
herbivory  (cages),  increased  sediments,  or  a  combination  of
these factors. Growth in the cages was probably a result of the
reduction  in  grazing  [33,35].  While  sediment  addition  may
increase  algal  turf  length  as  a  result  of  the  algae  investing
greater energy resources in linear extension to reach light [44]
and/or  increased  availability  of  nutrients  desorbed  from  the
sediment  [13,45].  In  both  cage  and  sediment  treatments  the
algal  growth  was  rapid  and  occurred  soon  after  the  initial
manipulations were made, while any added sediment was still
present. The growth of the EAMs slowed rapidly as sediment
loads diminished. Notably, there was no growth of macroalgae,
only an increase in turf length. Whether the time for macroalgal
development  was  insufficient,  if  propagules  or  juveniles  were
absent  or  if  the  high  hydrodynamic  activity  at  this  site  limited
development  of  macroalgae  [10,42],  the  key  result  is  that
responses  of  algal  turfs  with  artificially  reduced  herbivory
(cages)  were  comparable  to  those  with  increased  sediment
loads.

Remarkably, after the initial growth of the algal filaments the
new, longer, EAMs remained for at least three months in both
caged and open plots. The three treatments followed different
trajectories: (1) by reducing herbivory, cages maintained a long
EAM  regardless  of  sediments  (as  in  previous  studies,  e.g.
[31,34]).  (2)  In  open  plots,  EAMs  likewise  remained  long,  but
only if exposed to sediment. This was particularly striking given
the  rapid  loss  of  sediment.  It  may  be  that  the  vertical
distribution of the remaining sediments through the EAM plays
an important role in deterring herbivores, or that changes in the
microbial  community  [46,47]  or  detrital  load  of  the  turfs  [48]
made them less palatable to herbivores. The methods used in
this study, however, could not detect any of these factors and,
as  such,  further  study  is  necessary  to  determine  what  is
underpinning  this  stability.  However,  the  lack  of  recovery  is
worrying  as  it  highlights  that  reefs  are  slow  to  recover  from
sediment-induced disturbances, even short, ‘pulsed’ events. (3)
The  partially  caged  plots

trajectories to their equivalent open plots, however, the longer
EAMs appeared to ‘recover’ (i.e. reduce in length) as sediment
was removed. The apparent ‘recovery’ of the EAM in the partial
cages  was  unexpected.  It  was  expected  that,  as  herbivores
had  access  to  the  benthos,  the  EAMs  would  follow  the
responses  seen  in  the  open  plots.  However,  this  difference
appears  to  be  a  result  of  increased  herbivory  in  the  partial
cages.  The  partial  cages  increased  topographic  complexity,
and  provided  shelter  for  a  range  of  reef  herbivores  allowing
localised increases in grazing (cf. [49–52]).

We  found  that  the  growth  of  EAMs  after  a  one-week
sediment pulse was equivalent to, or greater than, that seen in
simulated  herbivore  removals  using  cages.  While  increased
sediment  is  often  considered  deleterious  to  reefs,  most
information pertaining to its effects are at a physiological scale,
considering  the  impact  on  individual  organisms  [53];  little  is
known  about  how  sediments  affect  the  broader  ecosystem
functions on which coral reefs rely [54]. At physiological scales,
sediments have deleterious impacts on almost all benthic reef

settlement  of  reef  corals  as  they  create  a  mobile  substrate,
preventing  access  to  the  consolidated  reef  matrix  [14,29].
Furthermore,  benthic  sediments  reduce  survival  of  post-
settlement  corals  particularly  during  their  early  development
presumably due to abrasion and shading [29,55]. In addition to
affecting benthic coral reef organisms, our findings suggest that
increased sediments might suppress herbivory resulting in the
development  and  persistence  of  longer  EAMs  driving  further
implications  for  reef  ecosystems.  Reduced  herbivory  through
increased  fishing  pressure  is  widely  publicised  as  a  major
threat to coral reefs on a global scale [56], but it appears that
short-term  increases  in  sediment  release  or  resuspension
through  anthropogenic  activities  (e.g.  [5,38,57])  have  the
potential to have similar effects at localised scales.

The manipulation used in this study is comparable to that of
other  short-term  (acute)  perturbations  caused  by  natural  or
anthropogenic  disturbances.  Storms  and  cyclones  can  move
sediment from areas with high natural loads, such as lagoons
or reef flats, which, as with this study site, may be only a few
tens  of  meters  away  [58].  Storms  can  also  increase  runoff  to
inner  and  mid-shelf  reefs  [8,9,59].  Similarly,  anthropogenic
sediment perturbations caused by dredging and other shallow-
water  maritime  activities  can  resuspend  sediments  [5,60,61].
These  events  may  all  generate  long  EAMs  similar  to  those
seen  after  the  experimental  sediment  manipulation.  An  even
greater  impact  may  be  observed  if  these  events  happen  in
succession, without sufficient recovery time. The longer EAMs
generated in this study persisted for at least 3 months, with no
obvious  sign  of  recovery.  If  disturbances  increasing  sediment
loads occurred more often than this, there is the risk that the
turfs  may  grow  longer  still  and  persist  for  longer  periods.  An
assessment  of  the  recovery  time  is  necessary  to  assess
whether such a ratchet effect (sensu [62]) is likely to lead to the
disruption of ecological processes on reefs.

It is essential to note that our observations are of the effects
of ‘natural’ carbonate dominated sediments, which characterise
offshore  coral  reefs.  The  disturbance  induced  by  this  study,
therefore, represents the best-case scenario for the effects of
sediments on reefs. Terrigenous sediments, with higher silicate
and  nutrient  loads  alongside  a  high  likelihood  of  associated
pollutants 
fertilisers  and
pesticides), are likely to have even greater impacts [38,63].

Although  our  study  did  not  find  evidence  to  support  the
existence  of  a  positive  feedback  leading  to  sediment-laden
turfs, a clear and lasting effect was observed following an acute
disturbance,  with  the  development  of  a  long-turfed  EAM.
Longer  EAMs  on  reefs  have  the  potential  to  reduce  coral
settlement  [29],  provide  inferior  grazing  surfaces  for  fishes
[10,11],  and  present  an  ecologically  and  economically  less-
desirable  state  [2].  The  development  of  these  long  EAMs
appears  to  be  driven  by  increases  in  both  benthic  sediments
and reductions in herbivory. In a world where reefs are affected
