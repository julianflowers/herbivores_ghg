Abstract

Oceanic pH is projected to decrease by up to 0.5 units by 2100 (a process known as ocean acidification, OA), reducing the
calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans. The coastal ocean is expected to experience periods of even lower
carbonate saturation state because of the inherent natural variability of coastal habitats. Thus, in order to accurately project
the impact of OA on the coastal ocean, we must
first understand its natural variability. The production of
dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine algae and the release of DMSP’s breakdown product dimethylsulphide
(DMS) are often related to environmental stress. This study investigated the spatiotemporal response of tropical macroalgae
(Padina sp., Amphiroa sp. and Turbinaria sp.) and the overlying water column to natural changes in reefal carbonate
intracellular DMSP and water column DMSP+DMS concentrations between the
chemistry. We compared macroalgal
environmentally stable reef crest and environmentally variable reef flat of the fringing Suleman Reef, Egypt, over 45-hour
sampling periods. Similar diel patterns were observed throughout: maximum intracellular DMSP and water column DMS/P
concentrations were observed at night, coinciding with the time of lowest carbonate saturation state. Spatially, water
column DMS/P concentrations were highest over areas dominated by seagrass and macroalgae (dissolved DMS/P) and
phytoplankton (particulate DMS/P) rather than corals. This research suggests that macroalgae may use DMSP to maintain
metabolic function during periods of low carbonate saturation state. In the reef system, seagrass and macroalgae may be
more important benthic producers of dissolved DMS/P than corals. An increase in DMS/P concentrations during periods of
low carbonate saturation state may become ecologically important in the future under an OA regime, impacting larval
settlement and increasing atmospheric emissions of DMS.

Introduction

The carbonate chemistry of

the oceans is regulated by a
is driven by the dissolution of
carbonate equilibrium that
atmospheric CO2 into the oceans. Since the Industrial Revolution,
atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased from 280 ppm to
,390 ppm; CO2 concentrations have been increasing by ,2 ppm
yr21 since 2000 [1]. It is projected that continued anthropogenic
emissions of CO2 will cause the pH of the oceans to drop by 0.3–
0.5 units by 2100 [2], a process known as ocean acidification (OA).
This rate of change has been estimated to be ,100 times faster
than during glacial terminations [3], raising concerns over the
future survival of calcifying organisms.

Coastal habitats such as coral reefs are characterised by more
extreme natural variations in carbonate saturation state compared
to the open ocean, reflecting diurnal and seasonal cycles driven by
biological and physical processes [3]. Thus, in order to accurately
project the impact of an OA scenario on coastal ecosystems, one

must first understand contemporary natural variability. Spatial
heterogeneity of carbonate chemistry has been observed in coral
flats and lagoons more variable than
reef systems, with reef
fringing forereefs due to biological
(benthos composition) and
physical
(wave action and residence time) variables [4,5,6,7,8].
Similarly, surface pCO2 in atoll and barrier reef lagoons may be
higher than offshore waters [9]. Where the benthos is dominated
by filamentous turf algae, pH may be high (i.e. less acidic) [7].
Short-term and longer-term temporal heterogeneity in reefal
carbonate chemistry has also been observed. During the day, net
calcification may be observed, whilst net dissolution may be
observed at night [8], influencing the carbonate chemistry of the
overlying water column. Seasonal patterns in carbonate chemistry
have been observed [10] but this may be de-coupled from reef
calcification due to the maintenance of threshold saturation levels
during the winter [11].

The response of calcified organisms to reduced carbonate
saturation state is varied depending on their carbonate structure,

their method of calcification and their ability to benefit from an
increase in CO2 (e.g. for photosynthesis) [12]. This has led to the
suggestion that, under an OA scenario, coral reefs may become
dominated by macroalgae (fleshy and coralline) [13]. The negative
effect of low carbonate saturation state on the calcification and
growth of red coralline algae (which deposit high-magnesium
calcite,
thermodynamically unstable carbonate poly-
morph) has been well reported. During the winter, net calcification
in the temperate/polar coralline alga Lithothamnion glaciale was
significantly reduced at high CO2 (750, 950 and 1500 ppm), whilst
only the very high CO2 treatment (1500 ppm) induced a decrease
in calcification in the summer [14]. Growth rates and structural
integrity of L. glaciale may also be reduced under high CO2 (589–
1080 matm) [15,16]. After a 1 year exposure to high CO2
conditions (700 ppm), net dissolution exceeded net calcification in
Lithophyllum cabiochae
[17], and when combined with high
temperature (+3uC) more algal necroses, death and dissolution
were observed [17]. Spore production, growth and recruitment of
the Corallinaceae are also inhibited by high CO2 conditions (550–
760 ppm) [18,19,20]. Additionally, high CO2 (1000 ppm) and UV
radiation (particularly UVB) may act synergistically to inhibit
growth, photosynthetic O2 evolution and calcification in the
geniculate coralline alga Corallina sessilis [21].

In the field, calcifying organisms may decrease in abundance
under high, variable pCO2 conditions [22]. Despite this, Padina
spp. (Ochrophyta: Dictyoaceae), one of only two known calcifying
brown algae, appear to thrive in CO2 vent systems, albeit with
reduced calcification in the more acidified areas [23], attributed to
the lower abundance of grazing sea urchins in acidified areas and
from higher CO2 availability [23].
enhanced photosynthesis
Experimental reef studies (conducted in 2650 m3 mesocosms
dominated by macroalgae) suggest
that although calcification
appears to decline under high CO2 conditions, net organic
production does not change [24,25]. However, current studies are
not wholly conclusive and more detailed investigations into the
biochemical and morphological effects of low carbonate saturation
state on calcifying benthic macroalgae are still required.

[31] and attractant

Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is a sulphur compound
produced by many marine algae and is the major precursor to
dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas that may be linked to local climate
regulation through aerosol production and cloud formation
[26,27]. A number of cellular functions have been described for
DMSP in macro- and microalgae, including as a compatible solute
[28], a cryoprotectant [29], an antioxidant [30] and a herbivore
deterrent
[32]. A general reduction in
intracellular DMSP concentrations with increasing latitude has
been suggested for macroalgae in the northern hemisphere [31],
perhaps in response to the cryoprotective properties of DMSP
[29]. However, this suggestion was based primarily on Chlor-
ophyta species,
the abundance of which also increases with
increasing latitude.
secondary
metabolites (e.g.
tend to increase in low latitudes,
perhaps due to increased grazing pressure [33]. The principal
functions of DMSP have not been extensively studied and the lack
of data available on macroalgal DMSP concentrations currently
prevents such assessments to be made.

In contrast, other macroalgal

terpenes)

Information on the effect of reduced carbonate saturation state
on intracellular DMSP concentrations in algae is limited and has
provided variable results. Intracellular DMSP concentrations in
the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca and U. clathrata was not affected
by elevated pCO2 conditions (up to 1514 matm) [34]. However, in
the non-geniculate red coralline alga L. glaciale, reduced pH
(pH 7.7), particularly when variable,
led to an increase in
intracellular DMSP concentrations [16]. Species-specific responses

Diurnal DMSP Patterns on a Tropical Reef

have also been observed in phytoplankton. An up-regulation of
intracellular DMSP has been observed in Emiliania huxleyi under
high temperature and high CO2 (+4uC/1000 ppm) [35]; (+6uC/
790 ppm) [36]. In contrast, intracellular DMSP concentrations
were reduced in Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum
under high temperature and CO2 (+6uC/790 ppm) [36].

In tropical reef environments,

intracellular DMSP may be
important as an antioxidant, grazing deterrent and/or compatible
solute. Recent studies also suggest that intracellular DMSP may
play a role in improving tolerance to variable carbonate chemistry
conditions [16]. Corals from environmentally variable conditions
(e.g. reef lagoons and flats) may be more thermally tolerant than
those from more stable conditions (e.g. reef crests) [37]. Thus, it
may be expected that organisms (e.g. corals and macroalgae) on
reef flats have also developed mechanisms (e.g. up-regulation of
DMSP) to become more tolerant of carbonate system variability
compared to those on reef crests. This study assessed natural
spatiotemporal variability of
intracellular DMSP and water
column DMSP+DMS (DMS/P) concentrations in the fringing
reef environment of the Red Sea and related this to the carbonate
chemistry of the overlying water column. It was hypothesised that
(1) intracellular DMSP and water column DMS/P concentrations
would fluctuate more on the environmentally variable reef flat
compared to the environmentally stable reef crest and (2) corals
would be the primary source of DMS/P in the reef system, as was
observed on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia [38,39].

Materials and Methods

Study Site and Field Sampling Design

Research was conducted on the fringing Suleman Reef, Gulf of
Aqaba, northern Red Sea, Egypt (28u289N, 34u309W) in August
2011. This reef is characterised by four distinct zones: seagrass
beds nearest the shore, the reef flat 40–60 m from the shore, the
reef crest 100–120 m from the shore and the reef slope which
extends away from the reef crest to a depth of ,10 m. On
average, water depth was uniform across
the reef platform
(,0.8 m). All research was approved by the Dahab Marine
Research Center and the Marine Environmental Center, Suez
Canal University, provided the permit to conduct the research.

Water and macroalgal samples were taken at the reef

flat
(dominated by fleshy and coralline macroalgae) and the reef crest
(dominated by small branching corals, macroalgae and encrusting
coralline algae) over two 45-hour experimental periods, at T14,
T21, T29, T38 and T45 hours (Where T0 was 00:00 on day one).
In situ water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were
recorded at each timepoint using a YSI Pro 2030 instrument. In
situ photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the sea bed was
recorded hourly at the reef flat and reef crest using an Apogee
QSO-E underwater quantum sensor and Gemini voltage data
logger.

Carbonate Chemistry

At each timepoint, water samples were preserved for carbonate
chemistry with MgCl2 [40] and stored in the dark for subsequent
total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) analysis.
DIC was determined using a CO2 Coulometer (CM5014 v.3, UIC
Ltd.) with acidification module (CM5130 v.2, UIC Ltd.) and
methods described by Dickson et al. [40]. TA was determined
using the 2-stage open-cell titration method [40]. In situ TA, DIC,
temperature and salinity measurements were used to calculate pH,
22 concentrations and calcite (VCa) and
pCO2, HCO3
aragonite (VAr)

Statistics

Intracellular DMSP

Three macroalgal species were analysed for intracellular DMSP
(n = 10 per species, per timepoint, per location): Padina sp.
(Ochrophyta: Dictyotales), Amphiroa sp. (Rhodophyta: Corallinales)
and Turbinaria sp.
(Ochrophyta: Fucales). Both Padina sp. and
Amphiroa sp. were found on the reef crest and reef flat; Turbinaria sp.
was found only on the reef crest. Macroalgal samples (,0.2 g)
were stored in 10 M NaOH in gas-tight glass vials sealed with
Pharma-Fix (Grace Alltech) crimp lids to hydrolyse all intracellular
DMSP into DMS. Vials were stored in the dark until DMS
quantification.

Water Column DMSP

At each sampling timepoint, water samples were collected from
the reef flat and reef crest (n = 5 per location per timepoint), from
15 cm above the seabed. 50 ml water samples were filtered using a
0.7 mm depth filter (Millepore). The filtrate and filter paper were
stored in glass vials sealed with Pharma-Fix septa at a final
concentration of 0.33 M NaOH. These samples represented the
total dissolved and particulate DMS+DMSP pool
(DMSPt).
Logistical constraints limited DMSPt sample collections to the
first 45-hour sampling period only.

Reef Transect – Spatial Variation

In addition to the reef flat/reef crest diel comparison, water
samples (n = 3 per location) were also taken at one timepoint
(16:00) along a transect perpendicular to the shore at
five
locations: at the seagrass bed (10 m from the shore), on the reef
flat (50 m from the shore), crest (100 m from the shore) and slope
(120 m from the shore) and 270 m offshore (sandy bottom, no
discernible macro-primary production). Samples were prepared
for DMSPt using the methods described above.

DMSP Analysis

All DMSP samples were analysed using a Shimadzu 2014 gas
chromatograph (GC) fitted with a 25 m capillary column (Restek
RTx-5MS 30 m column, 0.25 mm ID) and a sulphur-specific FPD
detector (injector port and column oven temperature: 45uC,
detector: 200uC). Samples were analysed within 2 months of
collection. Intracellular DMSP samples were analysed by direct
injection of the vial headspace into the GC injector port. Water
column DMSPt samples were pre-concentrated using the purge
and cryotrap technique [45] before injection into the GC. Sample
concentrations were quantified from DMSP standard calibration
curves (DMSP standard from Research Plus Inc.). The limit of
detection was 960 ng S per 100 ml headspace injection and
0.64 ng S per injection using the cryotrap system; standard and
sample precision was within 3%.

Proportion Calcified

The proportion of Padina sp. and Amphiroa sp. from the reef crest
and flat that was calcified was determined by recording the mass of
samples before and after overnight storage in 10 M NaOH to
break down the organic material. The mass remaining represented
the calcified portion, which was expressed as a percentage of the
original mass. The proportion of Amphiroa sp. from the reef crest
that was calcified could not be calculated as the carbonate
structure broke down in the NaOH preventing final mass
assessment.

Diurnal DMSP Patterns on a Tropical Reef

Intracellular DMSP measurements could not be transformed to
achieve normality and homogeneity of variance, thus a non-
parametric multi-comparison Kruskall-Wallis test was performed
to compare the data sets. Transect DMSPt data were analysed
using general linear models (test assumptions met). Analyses were
conducted using Minitab V15.

Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) were used to assess the
relationship between the reefal abiotic parameters and measured
macroalgal and water column DMSP concentrations. GAMs were
conducted in R (V2.14.2) using the ‘mgcv’ package [46]. Thin
plate regression splines were used as the smoothing basis, allowing
multiple predictors to be considered and reducing subjectivity as
knot locations (i.e. where splines join) are not manually specified
[46]. Abiotic parameter interactions were identified using the ‘tree’
package in R. The most parsimonious GAM for each DMSP
dataset was determined using generalised cross validation tech-
niques (GCV) [46].

Results

Water Chemistry

Both the reef crest and reef

flat exhibited a diel trend in
water temperature: highest water temperatures were in the
afternoon and lowest temperatures were at dawn (Figure 1A).
Whilst minimum water temperature on the reef flat and reef
crest were the same (26.0uC), maximum temperatures were
higher on the reef flat than the reef crest (29.1uC compared to
27.5uC), resulting in the reef
flat having a wider temperate
(3.15uC and 1.5uC respectively,
range than the reef crest

flat (60–160%) than the reef crest (110–70%, Figure

characterised by a relatively high variability at 21:00 (T21+T45)
and 07:00 (T29, Figure 2C). DMSPt did not differ significantly
between the crest and flat (T22 = 20.18, p = 0.862, Figure 2D), but
there was suggestion of a diurnal trend, with elevated concentra-
tions at 21:00 (T21+T45) compared to 14:00 (T14+T38),
particularly on the reef flat.

Associations between Environmental Conditions and
DMSP

Carbonate chemistry parameters were present

in the most
parsimonious GAM models for all DMSP datasets (Table 1).
Water temperature was significantly associated with intracellular
DMSP concentrations in Amphiroa sp. (reef crest and flat, Table 1).
Dissolved oxygen was significantly associated with intracellular
DMSP concentrations in Padina sp. (reef crest), Turbinaria sp. (reef
crest) and water column DMSPt (reef
flat, Table 1). The %
deviance explained by the GAM models was generally higher for
reef flat datasets, except Padina sp. (reef crest: 66%, reef crest: 44%
deviance explained, Table 1).

Transect DMSPt

A significant difference in DMSPt was observed between the
five transect sampling sites (F4 = 10.38, p = 0.001)
(Figure 3).
DMSPt on the reef crest (17.2960.53 nmol L21, mean6SE) and
slope (14.6761.11 nmol L21) were significantly lower than the
seagrass (23.3862.04 nmol L21) and offshore (23.8961.29 nmol
L21)
flat exhibited an intermediate DMSPt
concentration (18.3260.66 nmol L21).

Proportion Calcified

No significant difference in the proportion of thallus that was
calcified was observed between Padina sp. samples from the reef
crest (56.5616.0%, mean6SD) and flat (51.564.7%, T1 = 0.30,
p = 0.816). The proportion for Amphiroa sp. on the reef flat that was
calcified was 43.665.0%. The proportion of Amphiroa sp. on the
reef crest that was calcified could not be determined, although
visually these samples appeared to be more heavily calcified.

Discussion

Biological Control of Carbonate Chemistry

Biological processes, particularly photosynthesis/respiration and
calcification/dissolution can strongly influence the carbonate
chemistry of tropical reefs [4,7,8]. The Suleman reef platform
was, on average, only 0.8 m deep, thus biological processes are

likely to have strongly influenced the observed diel patterns in
carbonate chemistry, probably due to the low surface area to
volume ratio [47]. In general, carbonate parameters were more
variable on the reef flat compared to the reef crest. The diel
difference between CO2 utilisation and release was likely higher on
the reef flat than the crest due to the high proportion of macroalgal
cover on the reef flat. CO2 uptake for photosynthesis during the
day (which reduces DIC) and release by respiration at night (which
increases DIC) were the probable drivers of the diel pattern in
DIC concentrations. This proposed biological control mechanism
was also reflected in the dissolved oxygen concentrations, which
were ,160% saturated during the day (release from photosyn-
thesis) and ,60% saturated during the night
(uptake for
respiration) on the reef flat (see Figure S1A, supporting informa-
tion). The TA and DIC measurements observed in Suleman Reef
are within the range cited for other tropical reef systems [47]. Such
large diel changes in oxygen saturation have also been reported for
Puerto Rican reefs (62–138%) [6].

Species-specific Intracellular DMSP Concentrations

in more extreme conditions

Intracellular DMSP concentrations of Red Sea tropical
macroalgae in this study were higher than intracellular DMSP
concentrations reported for the same genera from Australia [39]
and the Caribbean [48]. Restricted water circulation within the
Gulf of Aqaba results
(salinity,
temperature and carbonate chemistry) compared to other tropical
reefs [49], which may necessitate an increase in intracellular
DMSP relative to other tropical reef environments. Despite this,
inter- and intra-species differences in intracellular DMSP concen-
trations were observed in the macroalgae of Suleman Reef, with
Amphiroa sp.
(crest and
flat).Turbinaria sp. (crest). Grazing pressure may have contributed
to the species-specific and diel patterns in intracellular DMSP
concentrations, as grazing pressure is typically highest at night on
tropical reefs [50] and DMSP may be an important grazing
defence mechanism in macroalgae [51,52,53].

Diel Regulation of DMSP

[51,52,53]. Our results also suggest

The production of DMSP by algae is energetically costly [54],
thus the regulation of DMSP in response to environmental change
(e.g. hypersalinity) may be relatively slow [55]. However, the
principal functions of DMSP in algae under varying environmen-
tal conditions are not well understood. Overall, a clear diel pattern

intracellular DMSP and water column DMSPt
concentrations was observed, with DMSP concentrations typically
supporting the macroalgal grazing defence
highest at night,
hypothesis
that DMSP
concentrations were driven, at least in part, by the reefal carbonate
chemistry. Thus,
intracellular DMSP may play a role in
maintaining macroalgal cellular
low
carbonate saturation conditions, although other factors may also
play a role (e.g. nutrients, grazing pressure). In temperate red
coralline algae, DMSP may be up-regulated in response to acute
changes in saturation state [16], thus it may be proposed that the
algae sampled in this study also respond to decreases in saturation
state by up-regulating intracellular DMSP concentrations. DMSPt
will have consisted of benthic, detrital, land and phytoplankton
material. DMSPt on the reef flat was well described by dissolved
oxygen and pH (81% deviance explained); whilst DMSPt on the
reef crest was not well described by any of the measured abiotic
parameters (most parsimonious parameter: VCa, 27% deviance
explained), suggesting that DMSPt on the crest was influenced by
offshore waters more than DMSPt on the reef
flat (different
phytoplanktonic community for example).

suggests that either DMSP was utilised during the day and
replenished at night or there was a lag in the response of
intracellular DMSP in Amphiroa sp. to ROS production (perhaps
due to the energy outlay required) [54]. However, such a long lag

in DMSP response (seven hours or more) may not be an effective
mechanism against oxidative damage.

Dissolved oxygen levels remained well above the suggested level
for hypoxic impact (,30% saturation) [56] and the effect of
reduced oxygen saturation on the intracellular DMSP concentra-
tions of macroalgae is not known. However, dissolved oxygen did
appear to influence the intracellular DMSP concentrations of
Padina sp. and Turbinaria sp., suggesting that DMSP may be up-
regulated during periods of low oxygen saturation.

Benthic Producers of DMSP

Tropical corals have been described as one of

the most
important benthic sources of DMSP and DMS in the coastal
zone [39]. Most data are from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR),
Australia but the sources of water column DMSP and DMS are
undefined. The GBR is also morphologically and hydrographically
different to the fringing reef of this study. Results from this study
that other macro-primary producers may be more
suggest
important sources of DMSPt
than corals. Nearshore DMSPt
concentrations were highest in areas dominated by seagrass beds
and macroalgae (on the reef flat) rather than corals (reef crest and
slope). DMSPt concentrations were also elevated at the offshore
site, where the primary source is likely to have been phytoplank-
ton. Importantly, DMSP in the water column is available to
microorganisms for potential breakdown into DMS, which is then
available for atmospheric flux. Given the shallow water depth of
the Suleman Reef platform (,0.8 m), the inshore reef areas may
be important sources of atmospheric DMS in the region.

Structural Tolerance to Variable Conditions

Calcification in Amphiroa sp.

(high-magnesium calcite) was
visibly reduced on the reef flat, suggesting that the algae were,
relatively speaking, partially decalcified in the more variable
conditions. This could not be quantitatively confirmed but changes
to the calcite structure of red coralline algae in response to variable
carbonate saturation has been observed in the temperate coralline
alga Lithothamnion glaciale [16]. Grazing pressure may have also
contributed to the observed differences in calcification. In contrast,
the calcification of Padina sp.
(aragonite) was not significantly
different between the reef flat and reef crest, despite previous
reports of decalcified Padina sp. in naturally low pH environments
in Italy and Papua New Guinea [23].

intracellular DMSP
concentrations may be regulated in response to variability in
reefal carbonate chemistry, helping to maintain cellular function
during periods of lower carbonate saturation. Macroalgal intra-
cellular DMSP regulation may also impact
the function of
macroalgae within the reefal ecosystem. Coralline algae are
important settlement cues for invertebrate larvae, particularly
corals, e.g. [57,58], a function which may be reduced under high-
CO2 conditions [59] and which may be driven by intracellular
DMSP concentrations [60]. It is projected that other calcifying
reef organisms such as urchins may be detrimentally affected by
OA, e.g. [22,61,62], impacting the food web dynamics of the reef
ecosystem and perhaps allowing a phase shift towards macroalgae
dominance to occur [63]. A shift towards macroalgal dominance
may subsequently impact DMSP biogeochemistry, affecting
ecosystem function and perhaps resulting in higher water column
DMSPt concentrations. This will
increase the potential atmo-
spheric emissions of DMS from the area, with subsequent impacts
on local climate regulation [26,27].
