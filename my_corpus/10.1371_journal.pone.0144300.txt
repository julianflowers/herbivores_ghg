Abstract

Root biomass distributions have long been used to infer patterns of resource uptake. These
patterns are used to understand plant growth, plant coexistence and water budgets. Root
biomass, however, may be a poor indicator of resource uptake because large roots typically
do not absorb water, fine roots do not absorb water from dry soils and roots of different spe-
cies can be difficult to differentiate. In a sub-tropical savanna, Kruger Park, South Africa, we
used a hydrologic tracer experiment to describe the abundance of active grass and tree
roots across the soil profile. We then used this tracer data to parameterize a water move-
ment model (Hydrus 1D). The model accounted for water availability and estimated grass
and tree water uptake by depth over a growing season. Most root biomass was found in
shallow soils (0–20 cm) and tracer data revealed that, within these shallow depths, half of
active grass roots were in the top 12 cm while half of active tree roots were in the top 21 cm.
However, because shallow soils provided roots with less water than deep soils (20–90 cm),
the water movement model indicated that grass and tree water uptake was twice as deep
as would be predicted from root biomass or tracer data alone: half of grass and tree water
uptake occurred in the top 23 and 43 cm, respectively. Niche partitioning was also greater
when estimated from water uptake rather than tracer uptake. Contrary to long-standing
assumptions, shallow grass root distributions absorbed 32% less water than slightly deeper
tree root distributions when grasses and trees were assumed to have equal water demands.
Quantifying water uptake revealed deeper soil water uptake, greater niche partitioning and
greater benefits of deep roots than would be estimated from root biomass or tracer uptake
data alone.

Introduction
Plant uptake of soil resources is one of the most fundamental processes of life on earth. It is
believed to determine when, where and how much plants grow [1–3]. Particularly in arid and
semi-arid systems, which represent nearly half of terrestrial ecosystems, plant growth is highly
sensitive to soil water availability [4, 5] and plant coexistence is believed to reflect differences in

Measuring Water Uptake in Savannas

plant rooting patterns [3, 6, 7]. For example, Walter’s two-layer hypothesis suggests that
grasses predominate in savannas due to greater water use efficiency and dense shallow roots
but that woody plants can coexist with grasses due to deep roots [1, 8]. This hypothesis was
developed for drier savannas (i.e., < 500 mm precipitation), but it is often applied to a wide
range of arid and semi-arid ecosystems [8]. Testing this hypothesis requires measurements of
the location, timing and extent of water uptake by grasses and trees in the field, yet much of the
support for the two-layer hypothesis continues to be inferred from observations of root distri-
butions and not plant water uptake [6, 8–10].

Root biomass is fairly easy to measure but it may not be a good indicator of plant water
uptake [11–13]. Large, suberized roots represent a large portion of root biomass but do not
absorb soil water [11, 13]. Small, fine roots and root hairs do absorb soil water but only when
soil water is plant available [14, 15]. Also, it is often difficult to differentiate the roots of differ-
ent plant species [16, 17]. Natural abundance stable isotope analyses have provided valuable
insight into the depth of water uptake by different species in the field [10, 18–20], but this
approach typically allows only broad distinctions in water use, cannot distinguish water use
below 50 cm and can be difficult to execute where precipitation events are frequent [21, 22].
Where grass and tree roots have been differentiated by visual inspection, stable isotope analyses
or genetic testing, most tree roots have often been found in shallow soils suggesting that niche
partitioning cannot be large enough to allow grass and tree coexistence [17, 23, 24].

Lacking measurements of root water uptake and therefore direct evidence of niche parti-

tioning, some authors have suggested that aboveground factors alone, such as demography, fire
and herbivory determine tree and grass coexistence in savannas [7, 25]. Whether aboveground
or belowground processes determine savanna structure and function remains a significant
question [6]. Quantifying root water uptake is a necessary step towards addressing this ques-
tion [4, 10, 14] that has the added benefit of improving understanding of hydrologic cycles
[26–28].

Quantifying root water uptake by different plants in the field remains a difficult task [2, 12,
14]. Here we use a hydrologic tracer experiment to measure the abundance of active grass and
tree roots at different depths [27]. Because plants may absorb tracer from dry soils and because
tracer uptake doesn’t reveal the amount of soil water absorbed, we use a soil water movement
model to estimate the amount of water likely to flow through the active roots identified in the
tracer experiment [6, 15, 29]. More specifically, our general approach was to 1) inject the
hydrologic tracer deuterium oxide (D2O) into five soil depths, three times during a growing
season in a sub-tropical savanna to determine the proportion of tracer uptake from each depth
by dominant grasses and trees [12, 27], 2) parameterize Hydrus 1D, a widely-used soil water
movement model [15], with tracer-derived estimates of active root distributions. This approach
produced modeled estimates of the amount of water removed by grasses and trees from differ-
ent soil depths over a growing season [22, 29]. Model estimates were compared to independent
measurements of soil water content. Finally, to determine which rooting distribution provides
more water, we use the water movement model to estimate water uptake when grasses and
trees are equally abundant.

This research represents an attempt to use hydrologic tracer data in a soil water movement

model to estimate species-level water uptake at our study site. Here we rely on Penman-
Monteith (P-M) models to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) though these models were not
designed or validated for use in aerodynamically heterogeneous communities. While we vali-
date estimates of plant water uptake using soil water content data and constrain ET estimates
to match independent estimates of ET from a nearby eddy-covariance flux tower, we did not
validate independent components of the P-M model. Before this approach can be applied

broadly, critical components of this modeling approach, namely aerodynamic resistances and
preferential flow paths in the soil will need to be validated.

Methods
Research was conducted in a sub-tropical savanna on shallow clay soils during the 2009/2010
growing season, Letaba, Kruger National Park, South Africa (-23.429° S, 31.053° E; 200 m ele-
vation). This research was approved by South African National Parks, registration number
213896412. Soils are shallow (50–100 cm) red and dark clays derived from the underlying
basaltic bedrock [30]. Mean annual precipitation is 450 mm and 521 mm fell during the study
period, which included a notable mid-season drought (S1 and S2 Figs). The ‘mopaniveld’ vege-
tation is dominated by the tree Colophospermum mopane and the C4 grass Bothrichloa radi-
cans. Woody plant crown cover was 20 ± 3%. The Mopaniveld is described as a water-limited
ecosystem that covers about 555,000 km2 of southern Africa[30, 31]. C. mopane can grow to 15
m tall [32, 33], but was on average about 4 m at our site. Other woody plants included Combre-
tum apiculatum and Flueggia virosa but these plants represented less than 5% total vegetative
cover. The perennial grass Bothrichloa radicans dominated vegetative cover. In descending
order of abundance, the following perennial grasses were also common: Urochloa mosambicen-
sis, Panicum maximum, Aristida transvaalensis, Schmidtia pappophoroides and Digitara
eriantha.

Hydrological tracer experiment and root biomass
A depth-controlled tracer technique was used to assess the relative abundance of active roots
by depth and plant species [21]. Briefly, 48 10-m2 circular plots were placed 30 m apart in a
grid in a roughly 3.5 ha area. Three replicate plots were assigned to each depth (5, 10, 20, 30
and 70 cm) by month (December, February, April) treatment combination and the remaining
three plots were controls. On the assigned tracer addition date, 1 ml of D2O (70% deuterium,
30% hydrogen; Cambridge Isotopes, MA, USA) followed by 2 ml tap water was injected into
each of 444 pilot holes drilled in a 15 cm x 15 cm grid to the target depth in each plot resulting
in a total of 19,980 injection points over the season. Each 10 m2 plot therefore received 1.3 L or
0.13 mm of tracer water. This represented <10% of typical daily evapotranspiration (ET) at the
study site [27]. One to three days following tracer injection, non-transpiring tissues [21, 34]
from grasses and trees were clipped, placed in sealed glass sample tubes and kept on ice until
sample extraction (within two weeks). Sample timing was deduced from earlier research which
demonstrated peak tracer concentrations in plant tissues one to two days following injection
[12, 21]. Samples of common species were composited to produce 3–5 sub-replicate samples
for each species. During each sampling period, five to eight samples were removed for each tar-
get species from a control plot. Twenty-two species were sampled, though C. mopane (48%), B.
radicans (22%), A. transvaalensis (13%), P.maxicum (2%), S. pappophoroides (2%) and U.
mosambicensis (2%) and a mixture of forbs (7%) represented 94% of samples.

Soil cores were taken in each plot 2 to 3 days after injections. Samples from these cores were

used to measure root biomass, soil water content, soil water potential and isotope concentra-
tions. Soil subsamples were removed in 20 cm increments for most of the soil core but in 10 cm
increments above and below target injection depths (S3 Fig). Sampling was performed by a
team of four to five people to reduce sampler error [35]. For root biomass analyses, subsamples
were dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve. Coarse roots (i.e., above the sieve) and fine roots
(i.e., below the sieve) were collected and weighed together. For isotope analyses, plant and soil
samples were extracted using a batch cryogenic distillation procedure [36]. Samples with a
noticeable aroma or cloudy appearance were extracted with activated carbon. Extracted water

samples were pipetted into 2 ml vials, shipped to the University of Alaska Anchorage’s Envi-
ronment and Natural Resources Institute Isotope Laboratory and analyzed for hydrogen and
oxygen stable isotope ratios on a wavelength scanned cavity ring-down spectrometer (L1102-I
Cavity ring-down spectrometer; Picarro Instruments, CA, USA). Isotope values of water
extracted from plant and soil samples were reported in delta notation (δ) and converted to deu-
(cid:1) δ18O)
terium excess values (δe) to control for natural enrichment as follows: δe = δD–[(8
+ 10][37].

To account for tracer dilution differences associated with different-sized plants and rooting
zones, δe values were converted to proportional tracer uptake as a function of soil depth as fol-
; where Sn is the mean δe value of samples from treatment level n (e.g., grasses at
lows:
5 cm depth in the ﬁrst replicate plot in December), and C is the mean δe value of control sam-
ples for that functional group [21, 38]. In the denominator, values (i.e., Sn−C) were summed
across all depths from 1 to j (i.e., 5–70 cm). This value was calculated for each plant functional
type (i.e., grass or tree) in a plot, producing three replicate proportion values for each plant
type x depth x date combination. Variation in tracer uptake among replicate plots was assumed
to reﬂect variation in rooting distributions on the landscape and is the only source of reported
error.

Calculating species- and depth-specific ET
Tracer data provided estimates of the distribution of active grass and tree roots with depth. To
account for the presence of dry soils at different depths or times of year we used a soil water
movement model (Hydrus 1D). Hydrus 1D simulates water flow through the soil matrix, evap-
oration and water uptake from a single root distribution. Because Hydrus 1D simulates a single
root distribution, it was necessary to 1) combine tracer data from different plant types to pro-
duce a single root distribution that was used as a Hydrus 1D input, then 2) parse Hydrus 1D
model output of water uptake by all plant roots into grass and tree components.

To produce a single root distribution from species-level tracer uptake data, tracer data were

weighted by grass and tree ET (calculations described below). It would not be appropriate to
use the average of grass and tree rooting distributions because grass cover on the landscape is
much greater than tree cover. It also may not be appropriate to weight grass and tree root dis-
tributions by leaf area since one unit of grass leaf area may transpire more or less than one unit
of tree leaf area. To provide an example, our ET models may estimate that total ET during Jan-
uary was 30 mm. Multiplying this estimate by the proportion of grass and tree tracer uptake by
depth may reveal that grasses and trees transpired 8 and 2 mm from the 0–5 cm depths. In
this case the total root distribution used as input for Hydrus 1D was estimated to have 10 of 30
mm uptake or 33% of active roots in the 0–5 cm depths. This estimate of water uptake assumes
that water is always available at all soil depths. Hydrus 1D outputs of total root water uptake
accounted for dry soils but needed to be parsed to grass and tree components. We used the
same ET-based weightings used to create a single root distribution for model input to parse
model output. For example, due to dry surface soils, Hydrus 1D may estimate that only 5 mm
of soil water was absorbed by roots in the 0–5 cm depth in January. In this example, we would
assume that 80% of this total root water uptake was performed by grasses because grasses and
trees were estimated (under fully wet conditions) to transpire 8 and 2 mm of water from the
top 5 cm, respectively.

As a measure of inherent competitive ability, we were also interested in estimating how

much water grasses and trees absorbed when both were equally abundant. To do this, we cre-
ated a single root distribution as Hydrus 1D input by simply averaging the proportion of tracer
uptake by depth for grasses and trees. Parameterized in this way, Hydrus 1D estimated total

root water uptake by depth assuming grasses and trees had equal transpiration demands. To
parse total Hydrus 1D output into grass and tree components, total root water uptake was mul-
tiplied by the proportion of grass and tree tracer uptake at each depth.

Evapotranspiration models
ET was calculated for the four dominant grasses (A. transvaalensis, B. radicans, P.maxicum,
and U. mosambicensis) using the standard FAO Penman-Monteith (P-M) model [39] and a
similar model modified for use with trees was used for C. mopane [40]. These five species rep-
resented 87% of total leaf area. For each species, species-specific stomatal conductance and
plant height data were used to parameterize the P-M model. Because the P-M model was
parameterized to work with leaf area index values of 1.0 or more, ET was calculated for each
species assuming a leaf area index of 1.0 [22]. We then multiplied this ET estimate by observed
leaf area of the target species [22]. In other words, we assumed that a plant with 10% ground
cover transpired 10% as much as a plant with 100% ground cover [22].

Grass ET was estimated using the standard FAO P-M model calculated on an hourly basis

[40] as follows:

where ET is expressed as mm hour-1, λ is the latent heat of vaporization assumed to be 2.45 MJ

(MJ m-2 hour-1), es is the saturation water vapor pressure, ea is the actual vapor pressure, (es-ea)

(1.293 kg m-3), cp is the speciﬁc heat of the air at constant pressure (1.013 10−3 MJ kg-1°C-1), Δ
is the slope of saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve (kPa°C-1), γ is psychrometric
constant (0.067 kPa°C−1), rs is bulk surface resistance (s m-1), and ra is bulk aerodynamic resis-
tance (s m-1). Surface resistance is calculated as a function of plant leaf area and stomatal resis-
tance [39, 40]. Aerodynamic resistance is estimated from plant height and wind speed [39, 40].
This P-M model is essentially an energy budget model that partitions the energy in incoming
solar radiation among outgoing long-wave radiation, sensible heat in the air and soil and latent
heat.

The PM model should have produced reasonable estimates of ET for the continuous grass
canopy, but would not be appropriate for modelling ET in the discontinuous tree canopy. The
ET model we used for trees was developed and validated using discontinuous tree canopies in
orchards[41–43]. Tree ET was calculated using the following modified version of the P-M
equation[40–43]:

Leaf boundary layer conductance (ga, in m s-1) was estimated using a commonly used model
for trees proposed by Landsberg and Powell[41] but see[42], which accounts for the mutual

Where β and δ are empirical coefﬁcients [43], gmax is the maximum stomata conductance
determined with porometer measurements, Da is the ambient vapor pressure deﬁcit, and is the
photosynthetic photon ﬂux density on the leaf surface[44].

Stomatal conductance measurements were needed to estimate both rs and gmax and were

measured on focal species throughout the day on 8 dates from December to April using solid-
state leaf porometers (SC-1; Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA). To control for effects of
changing environmental conditions, conductance measurements were made from six domi-
nant target species every 15 minutes. Tree readings were taken from the top, middle, and lower
portions of the canopy. Adaxial conductance was not observed on tree leaves, but was mea-
sured on grasses. Conductance datasets were described with a best-fit polynomial curve to esti-
mate hourly conductance throughout the season[22].

Plant height, leaf area, projected leaf area and wind speeds were needed to estimate ra. Plant

heights were measured on 30 randomly-selected plants of each target species along a transect
during each sampling campaign. Leaf area was measured in 16 randomly selected 1 m2 plots
during each of six sampling periods. Plumb lines were used to indicate plot locations within
tree canopies. Clipped vegetation was frozen within six hours of sampling and scanned on a
portable leaf area scanner (CID Inc., Camas, WA, USA). Projected leaf area was measured as
leaf presence or absence in 500 points using a periscope-style densitometer with cross-hairs.
Sampling points were located every m along five 100-m long transects that were separated
by 30 m. Wind speed was measured at grass canopy height (0.3 m) and mid tree-canopy
height (2 m).

Hydrologic model
Proportional tracer uptake values were used to parameterize the hydrologic model, Hydrus 1D
[15]. This model simulates water flow through the soil and roots and provides estimates of soil
water content and root water uptake by depth as a function of climate, soil and plant traits. The
van Genuchten-Mualem hydraulic model was used with no hysteresis in the retention curves.
Water flow parameters were derived from measurements of soil texture, observed maximum
and minimum soil water contents and associated water potentials, and assumed bulk densities
of 0.8, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 g cm-3 for the 5, 10, 20, 30 and 70 cm depths, respectively. These
bulk densities were inferred from personal observation, were consistent with estimates derived
from soil texture-derived estimates [45], and were similar to previously reported values [46]
but were different from results in another study that did not observe increasing bulk density
with depth [47]. Pooling of water at the soil surface was not observed in the field and a low sur-
face bulk density was needed to prevent surface water accumulation in the model. This low sur-
face bulk density was consistent with the presence of some leaf litter, loose soil and worm

castings at the soil surface. Hydraulic conductivity (Ks) was not measured, so the inverse solu-
tion was used on data from the first month of the field season to select Ks values [15]. These Ks
values were used for the remainder of the season. Upper and lower boundary conditions were
defined as the atmosphere or a surface layer of water up to 2 cm deep and free drainage into
subtending soils, respectively. An ‘S-Shape’ water uptake reduction model was used. In this
submodel, the soil water potential at which root water uptake was reduced by 50% (i.e., the P50
value) was assumed to be -1.5 MPa. This value was chosen because leaf water potentials at the
site were commonly -2.5 MPa and stomatal control was not obvious in leaf conductance mea-
surements even in this dry range of leaf water potentials (Kulmatiski pers. obs). The exponent
in the S-shaped root water uptake stress response function (i.e., the P3 parameter) was set to
the recommended value of -3. The critical stress index value determines the extent to which
plants can compensate for low water availability at some depths. A small value allows plants to
compensate fully for dry soil layers, effectively eliminating the effect of rooting distributions, so
a large value of 0.8 was used. The hCritA parameter sets a minimum pressure head at the sur-
face beyond which evaporation is limited: a recommended value of -5MPa for fine-textured
soils was used. Consistent with observed heights, plant height was assumed to be 50 cm at the
beginning of the season and 100 cm for the rest of the season.

The P-M model is used to estimate ET by Hydrus 1D. The P-M model was developed for

well-watered crops and as a result tends to overestimate ET in non-irrigated wildland systems
[48, 49]. A ‘crop stress’ value is often used to modify the P-M model for use in wildland sys-
tems[42] but this is not an option in the Hydrus 1D model. To address this, we modified albedo
to 0.6 to produce ET estimates similar to the Malopeni gas flux exchange tower located 40 km
west of the study site [50]. We were forced to adjust albedo when using the Hydrus model
because there was no possibility in this model to account for stomatal control and because
plant water stress variables in the model did not sufficiently suppress water uptake. An inter-
ception constant value of 2 mm was used because we never observed an increase in shallow soil
moisture after 2 mm precipitation events.

Meteorological data used by Hydrus 1D and P-M models were recorded on site. Wind
speed (014A cup anemotmeter; MetOne, Grants Pass, OR, USA), temperature and relative
humidity (Campbell Scientific CS215), solar radiation (Apogee Instruments SP-110, Logan,
UT, USA), and precipitation (Texas Instruments TE-525, TX, USA) were measured hourly at
both grass (0.3 m) and tree height at mid canopy (2 m) and recorded on a Campbell Scientific
CR-1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA).

Hydrus 1D provides depth-specific estimates of soil water content over time. Model esti-

mates of soil water content were compared to independent estimates of soil moisture that were
measured at 10 soil depths between 5 and 170 cm using soil water potential sensors (Campbell
Scientific 229 sensors, Logan, UT, USA). Prior to installation, each sensor was calibrated using
an endpoint test and by taking measurements in soils from one of three appropriate depth
strata (0–30, 30–60, or 60–90 cm) that were equilibrated to each of five known water potentials
for 16 h [51]. Water potentials of the equilibrated soils were determined using the chilled-mir-
ror technique (WP4T water potential meter; Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA). Sensors
were placed in pilot holes established in the undisturbed wall of a soil pit located at the site
where micrometeorological measurements were made. A loop of sensor cable was placed
below the sensor to prevent the creation of a preferential flow path to the sensor. Calibrated
sensors were placed at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 160 and 170 cm in the soil profile. Following
sensor installation, the soil pit was filled and compacted and grass root mats were replaced. Soil
water potentials were converted to gravimetric soil moisture using published soil characteristic
curves [52].

Measuring Water Uptake in Savannas

In all cases, values of water uptake per depth strata were converted to a per cm basis by

dividing by the depth increment in the strata (i.e., 20 mm of water uptake from the 20–30 cm
depth strata was reported as 2 mm per cm in this strata). This allowed estimates of the depth at
which 50% of root biomass, tracer uptake or water uptake occurred. Values are reported as a
running average of 15 cm increments to smooth their distribution with depth.

Statistical Analyses
To test for a general pattern in tracer uptake by grasses and trees across the growing season, we
performed a three-way randomized factorial analysis for the effects of month, plant type and
depth on proportion uptake across the season. A generalized linear mixed model and logit link
was computed using the GLIMMIX procedures in SAS/STAT for Windows, Release 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina; Appendix).

Niche overlap was calculated using the proportion of tracer uptake and measures of plant avail-

the proportion that resource i is of the total resources used by species k, and Rj is a measure of
the availability of resource state j was used [54]. This unitless measure ranges from 0 to 1,
where 0 indicates that no resources are used in common (i.e., complete niche partitioning). To
determine if observed overlap values were likely to result by chance, the species utilization
matrices were compared to predictions from a randomized null model. Randomization algo-
rithm three in EcoSim ver. 7, in which niche breadth is retained and zero states are reshufﬂed,
was used because niche breadth did appear to differ by species, zero uptake did not appear to
be a ﬁxed species trait for any depth (i.e., all plants accessed some tracer from every depth sam-
pled during one time period or another), and this approach is usually superior in detecting
non-random overlap [55]. In this experiment, zero states would be depths from which a plant
does not access soil water. To estimate Rj, we used root uptake values by depth estimated by
Hydrus 1D [53]. Random niche overlap values were derived from 1000 Monte Carlo permuta-
tions of the data matrix. Observed overlap values were then compared to the distributions of
the randomized values. A P value of < 0.05 indicates that observed niche overlap values were
greater than or less than niche overlap values produced by the randomized model.

Results and Discussion
A total of 1040 plant and soil samples were analyzed for isotope ratios: 878 experimental plant
samples, 31 control plant samples, 100 experimental soil samples, and 31 control soil samples.
None of the control samples demonstrated δe values two SDs above the control mean for
grasses and trees, -20.82 ± 13.25 SD and -37.76 ± 11.26 SD, respectively. This suggested that
sample contamination was not a problem. In contrast, 84% of plant samples from experimental
plots demonstrated δe values greater than two SDs above the control mean (i.e., were consid-
ered to have received tracer [21]). Soil samples taken following tracer injection showed clear
differences in tracer concentration with depth among the treatments indicating that injections
placed tracers in the targeted soil depths (S3 Fig)[21, 22].

The distribution of root biomass indicated that half of root biomass occurred in the top 20

cm (Fig 1a). Tracer uptake differed by depth and plant type (S1 Table). Half of tracer uptake by

uptake (B) and modeled water uptake (C) by depth and the depth from which 50% of tracer or modeled water
uptake occurred for grasses and trees (D). Tracer uptake by depth (B) reflects the relative abundance of
active plant roots and shows that most plant roots are found in shallow soil. When these tracer uptake values
are used in a soil water model that accounts for water availability and transpiration demand, the proportion of
water uptake by depth (C) was estimated to be twice as deep as suggested by tracer uptake (B). In panels a-c
the mean values (± 1SE) are shown for target depths. Remaining values (without SE bars) are interpolated
and represent running averages (15-cm increments).

grasses and trees occurred in the top 12 and 21 cm, respectively (Fig 1b and 1c). Most tracer
uptake, therefore, occurred in shallow soils. Grasses, however, absorbed a greater proportion of
tracer than trees from the shallowest pulsed soils (i.e., 5 cm) and trees absorbed a greater pro-
portion of tracer than grasses from the deepest pulsed soils (i.e., 70 cm; Fig 1a; S1 Table, S4
Fig). These patterns of root biomass and tracer uptake were similar to grass and tree root distri-
butions in a nearby site where 50% of grass and tree root biomass occurred in the top 9 and 12
cm, respectively [16, 27]. Results were also similar to semi-arid sites from around the world
that demonstrate 50% of total root biomass in the top 7 to 28 cm [23, 56]. Tracer uptake depths
were also surprisingly similar to results obtained in a more mesic, sandy site in Kruger Park
that receives 750 mm precipitation [12]. Together, these results suggest that active root distri-
butions are similar across a wide range of precipitation regimes, soil types and plant species
[12, 21, 56]. These results also suggested that root biomass distributions were a good indicator
of active grass root distributions. While the tracer experiment produced root distribution pat-
terns that were similar to root biomass distributions in many sites around the world, tracer
data also distinguished active from inactive roots and grass from tree roots.

Tracer uptake data indicated the location and relative abundance of active plant roots but
not the amount of soil water absorbed by those roots [6, 28]. To estimate the amount of water
absorbed, we used the Hydrus 1D soil water model [15]. Model results suggested that 50% of
water uptake by grasses and trees occurred in the top 23 and 43 cm, respectively (Fig 1b and
1c). In both cases the depth from which the model estimated that plants obtained half of their
annual water was roughly twice as deep as that estimated from tracer uptake alone. This

occurred because deep soils provided a larger, more stable soil water pool (S5 Fig). More specif-
ically, the soil water model estimated that grasses and tress together removed 104 and 148 mm
of water from shallow (i.e., 0–20 cm) and deep (i.e., 20–90 cm) soils, respectively. It is impor-
tant to note that Hydrus 1D model results are deterministic and not associated with any error.
All error in Fig 1 reflects variation in tracer uptake among replicate experimental plots in the
tracer experiment.

Results had important implications for niche partitioning. Niche overlap calculated from

tracer data was very large (0.95) and significantly greater than the null model prediction (0.52,
P < 0.001). However, when calculated from modeled estimates of root water uptake, niche
overlap was not as large (0.82) and not significantly greater than the null model prediction
(0.79, P = 0.06). This occurred because deeper soils stored more soil water and as a result small
differences between grasses and trees in deep tracer uptake resulted in large differences in mod-
eled root water uptake (Fig 1). Therefore, estimates of water uptake that accounted for soil
water availability revealed patterns of niche partitioning that were not apparent from root dis-
tributions alone.

It has long been thought that grasses may be superior competitors for soil water, particularly

in more arid sites where precipitation events are often small, because dense root mats provide
grasses with access to soil water as it enters the soil [1, 7, 8, 57]. Here we found that when they
were assumed to be equally abundant, grasses and trees were estimated to remove 102 and 149
mm of soil water over the year, respectively. In other words, relatively shallow root distribu-
tions were estimated to provide grasses with 32% less water than slightly deeper tree root distri-
butions. This occurred because even in this fairly xeric savanna, many precipitation events
were large enough to ‘push’ soil water below the small, shallow soil pool in which most grass
roots were located. That water infiltrated below the majority of grass roots in this fairly xeric
site with clay soils and that grass and tree rooting patterns were similar in a mesic, sandy
savanna site [12], suggests that tree rooting distributions are likely to provide trees with access
to more soil water than grasses in many savanna systems.

Tree root distributions were estimated to provide trees with more water than grass root

distributions, yet grass leaf area (0.47 ± 0.05 m2 m-2) was more than twice tree leaf area
(0.20 ± 0.01 m2 m-2; S6 Fig). As a result, across the landscape, grasses were estimated to tran-
spire more than trees (i.e., 130 vs. 122 mm). This amount of tree transpiration (122 mm) repre-
sented 23% of precipitation and was intermediate between estimates derived from sap flux
measurements in nearby sites [57, 58]. Because tree root distributions were estimated to pro-
vide more water, but grasses demonstrated more leaf area, our results support other studies
that suggest that greater water use efficiency, greater access to shallow soil nutrient pools or
non-equilibrium processes (e.g., fire) but not superior access to soil water explains greater grass
abundance in savannas [7, 16].

While grasses have long been thought to rely on shallow soil water, here we quantify that
reliance: our water model estimated that grasses obtained half of their water from the top 23
cm of soil. This is important from a climate change perspective because warmer temperatures
are expected to result in fewer, larger precipitation events [59–61]. These larger precipitation
events are likely to ‘push’ water deeper into the soil profile. Our results indicate that precipita-
tion events that ‘push’ water below 23 cm at the study site are likely to increase tree relative
to grass growth. This prediction is consistent with results from a precipitation manipulation
experiment in a nearby site [27] and suggest that climate change and niche partitioning may
provide an additional explanation for the woody plant encroachment observed in many parts
of the world in the past several decades [62].

Results relied on a number of simplifying assumptions and models, yet provided reason-
able estimates of water dynamics. The P-M model was used by Hydrus 1D and was used to

create a single root distribution from tracer data. The P-M model is widely used in hydrologi-
cal and agricultural applications and is appealing for use in species-specific modeling because
it includes parameters for stomatal conductance and aerodynamic resistance. However, this
model was developed and tested for dense, well-watered monoculture crops. As a result, our
use of the P-M model was outside of common applications and the model overestimated ET
and had to be down-weighted to provide estimates that were consistent with independent
flux-tower measurements. This was more of a concern in the Hydrus 1D application where
the model was being used to quantitatively predict water flow. Model estimates of ET were
forced to be consistent with independent measures of ET by increasing albedo, but future
efforts are needed to improve estimation of ET in natural, mixed species communities. Our
P-M-derived values also overestimated ET, but because we used these values to determine
the relative and not absolute amount of grass and tree ET, our use of the P-M model was
buffered from the effects of overestimation. It is likely that future modeling efforts that
use ET models that are better suited to water-limited, natural plant communities (i.e.,
with mixed height canopies and variable aerodynamic resistances) will improve model pre-
dictions [48].

Another potential source of error was that Hydrus 1D simulates only one root distribution.

Hydrus 1D is widely used and tested as a soil water flow model, but the use of a water flow
model that can distinguish root water uptake of multiple plant species is likely to improve
model predictions [6, 63, 64]. For example, evaporative demand, sapflux rates, and different
plant traits such as aquaporin density and root water potentials, are likely to result in different
water flow rates from soils to roots, but these factors were not considered in this study. Finally,
sensitivities in the P-M and Hydrus 1D models are fairly well understood [15, 29] but we did
not perform sensitivity analyses of our integrated approach. Before our integrated approach
can be reliably applied over large-scale areas, future studies should test the approach in new
sites and determine the sensitivity of results to variation in factors such as preferential flow
paths, soil bulk density, different root distributions, spatial distribution of trees and grasses and
differences in water uptake by monoculture vs. mixed root systems.

Despite model assumptions, predicted soil water content was well correlated with

observed soil water content across the soil profile (R2 = 0.84; Fig 2) and at specific depths
(i.e., R2 values ranged from 0.59 to 0.80 for different soil depths; S5 Fig). Further, our tree ET
estimates were consistent with sapflux measurements in nearby sites [50, 57, 58]. Therefore,
important model parameters and outputs were consistent with several independent mea-
sures. It should be noted, however, that while predictions of soil moisture were broadly
similar to observations across the season, predictions for any particular hour or day were
sometimes widely different than observed values. This typically reflected a time lag in model
predictions that is likely to be caused by a lack of preferential flow path water movement in
the soil water model.

This research provides an example of how it may be possible to produce quantitative esti-
mates of water use by plant species in mixed communities in the field. This type of modeling
approach is needed because soil moisture data are quite rare yet critical for understanding bio-
sphere-atmosphere feedbacks under changing climate conditions [28]. Results from this study
suggest that this is a promising approach, though significant research remains to be done to
determine whether or not this approach will be effective in other sites and which variables are
most important to understanding water cycling and competition in mixed plant communities.
In this study, quantifying water uptake, rather than inferring water uptake patterns from root
distributions suggested that 1) water uptake is deeper, 2) niche partitioning is greater and 3)
deeper roots provide more water than would be estimated from measures of root biomass or
tracer uptake alone.
